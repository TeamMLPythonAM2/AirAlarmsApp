static maps present in this report. russian president vladimir putin’s announcement of “partial mobilization” on september 21 reflected many problems russia faces in its faltering invasion of ukraine that moscow is unlikely to be able to resolve in the coming months. [1] putin’s order to mobilize part of russia’s “trained” reserve, that is, individuals who have completed their mandatory conscript service, will not generate significant usable russian combat power for months. it may suffice to sustain the current levels of russian military manpower in 2023 by offsetting russian casualties, although even that is not yet clear. it will occur in deliberate phases, russian defense minister sergei shoigu said in an interview on september 21, likely precluding any sudden influx of russian forces that could dramatically shift the tide of the war. [2] russia’s partial mobilization will thus not deprive ukraine of the opportunity to liberate more of its occupied territory into and through the winter. putin and shoigu emphatically said that only reservists who have completed their initial military service will be mobilized, making clear that russia will not be expanding conscription. shoigu also declared that students will not be affected and told them to go about their studies without concern. [3] these comments were clearly intended to allay fears among the russian population that “partial mobilization” was code for general conscription. it is not clear how much of the russian reserve has already been deployed to fight in ukraine. western intelligence officials reportedly said in november 2021 that russia had called up “tens of thousands of reservists” as part of its pre-war mobilization. [4] ukrainian military officials reported in june 2022 that russian forces had committed 80,000 members of the mobilized reserve to fight in ukraine. [5] the russian military likely called up the most combat-ready reserves in that pre-war mobilization effort, which suggests that the current partial mobilization will begin by drawing on less combat-ready personnel from the outset. russian reserves are poorly trained to begin with and receive no refresher training once their conscription period is completed. russian mandatory military service is only one year, which gives conscripts little time to learn how to be soldiers, to begin with. the absence of refresher training after that initial period accelerates the degradation of learned soldier skills over time. shoigu referred to the intent of calling up reservists with “combat experience,” but very few russian reservists other than those now serving in ukraine have any combat experience. [6] reports conflict regarding how much training reservists called up in the partial mobilization will receive. shoigu described a deliberate training process that would familiarize or re-familiarize mobilized reservists with crew, team, detachment, and then platoon-level operations before deploying them to fight. that process should take weeks, if not months, to bring reservists from civilian life to war readiness. federation council committee on defense and security head viktor bondarev reportedly said that mobilized reservists would train for over a month before being deployed. [7] a military commissariat in kursk oblast, on the other hand, reportedly announced that reservists under 30 would deploy immediately with no additional training. [8] putin emphatically did not say that the russian nuclear umbrella would cover annexed areas of ukraine nor did he tie mobilization to the annexation. he addressed partial mobilization, annexation referenda in russian-occupied areas of ukraine, and the possibility of nuclear war in his speech—but as separate topics rather than a coherent whole. the fact that he mentioned all three topics in a single speech was clearly meant to suggest a linkage, but he went out of his way to avoid making any such linkage explicit. putin framed his comments about the possibility of russian nuclear weapons use in the context of supposed western threats to use nuclear weapons against russia. he claimed that western officials were talking about “the possibility and permissibility of using weapons of mass destruction—nuclear weapons—against russia.” he continued, “i wish to remind those who allow themselves such statements about russia that our country also has various means of attack...”  his comment on this topic concludes by noting that russia would use all means at its disposal in response to a threat to “the territorial integrity of our country, for the defense of russia and our people.” that comment could be interpreted as applying in advance to the soon-to-be annexed areas of occupied ukraine, but its placement in the speech and context do not by any means make such an interpretation obvious. nor is putin’s language in making this comment different from formal kremlin policy or from previous statements by russian officials. putin’s speech should not be read as an explicit threat that russia would use nuclear weapons against ukraine if ukraine continues counter-offensives against occupied territories after annexation. putin did not connect annexation with the partial mobilization either, defending the need for partial mobilization by referring to the length of the lines along which russian forces are now fighting and western assistance to ukraine. he noted that the front lines now stretch for more than a thousand kilometers to explain why more russian forces are needed. he and shoigu also heavily emphasized the false narrative that russia is fighting not ukraine but nato and the west. this narrative is not new. it is not even markedly different from the initial false justifications putin offered before ordering the invasion in february. [9] the formal kremlin position has long been that nato was pushing ukraine to war with russia, that nato was preparing to give ukraine nuclear weapons, and that nato forces were taking up or preparing to take up positions in ukraine. putin’s and shoigu’s repetitions of that line do not reflect an escalation in their rhetoric. russia’s partial mobilization will not transform the war this year and may or may not have a significant impact on russia’s ability to continue operations at their current level next year. ukraine and the west should neither dismiss it nor exaggerate it. key takeaways russian president vladimir putin’s announced “partial mobilization” will not materially affect the course of the war in the coming months. putin did not explicitly threaten to use nuclear weapons if ukraine continues counter-offensive operations to liberate occupied areas after russian annexation. ukrainian forces likely continued offensive operations around lyman. ukrainian forces conducted strikes north and east of kherson city as part of an operational-level interdiction campaign against russian logistics, military, and transportation assets in kherson oblast. ukrainian and russian sources identified three areas of kinetic activity on september 21: northwest of kherson city, near the ukrainian bridgehead over the inhulets river, and south of the kherson-dnipropetrovsk oblast border around vysokopillya. russian federal subjects (regions) are continuing crypto-mobilization efforts regardless of russian president vladimir putin’s declaration of partial mobilization. russian-appointed occupation administrators are likely increasing law enforcement and filtration measures in occupied areas of ukraine in preparation for russia’s sham annexation referenda. we do not report in detail on russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. we will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in ukrainian urban areas. we utterly condemn these russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, geneva conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports. ukrainian counteroffensives—southern and eastern ukraine russian main effort—eastern ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and two supporting efforts); russian subordinate main effort—capture the entirety of donetsk oblast russian supporting effort—southern axis russian mobilization and force generation efforts activities in russian-occupied areas ukrainian counteroffensives (ukrainian efforts to liberate russian-occupied territories) eastern ukraine: (vovchansk-kupyansk-izyum-lyman line) ukrainian forces likely continued counteroffensive operations toward lyman on september 21. russian milbloggers claimed that ukrainian forces attempted to break through russian defenses around yampil (just southeast of lyman) and in lyman itself. [10] russian milbloggers also claimed that russian and ukrainian troops are actively fighting in drobysheve (just northwest of lyman). while isw cannot independently verify these claims, they are consistent with previous visual evidence of ukrainian counteroffensive operations along the lyman-yampil-bilohorivka line. the ukrainian general staff also reported that ukrainian troops repelled an attempted russian attack near kupyansk, eastern kharkiv oblast, along the oskil river. [11] this report indicates that russian troops are likely engaged in limited attempts to threaten newly recaptured ukrainian positions along the right bank of the oskil river. southern ukraine: (kherson oblast) ukrainian military officials maintained operational silence regarding ukrainian ground attacks in kherson oblast on september 21 and reiterated that ukrainian forces are conducting an operational-level interdiction campaign in kherson oblast. ukraine’s southern operational command and the ukrainian general staff both noted that ukrainian strikes targeted russian equipment, logistics, transportation, and command and control assets in southern ukraine throughout the day. [12] social media footage provided visual evidence of the continuing ukrainian interdiction campaign against russian positions north and east of kherson city on september 20 and 21. geolocated footage showed the aftermath of ukrainian strikes on kherson city that reportedly hit a factory, a semiconductor plant, a russian base, and a ferry crossing near the antonivsky bridge. [13] ukraine’s southern operation command noted that ukrainian troops hit russian equipment and manpower concentrations and a command post of the 7th guards air assault division just north of kherson city in chornobaivka. [14] social media footage from september 20 also showed that ukrainian forces struck russian positions in nova kakhovka, about 60km east of kherson city, corroborating ukrainian claims of ukrainian strikes on russian positions in nova kakhovka. [15] ukraine’s southern operational command additionally stated that ukrainian troops hit russian command posts in beryslav raion (65km east of kherson city). [16] ukrainian and russian sources identified three areas of kinetic activity on september 21: northwest of kherson city, near the ukrainian bridgehead over the inhulets river, and south of the kherson-dnipropetrovsk oblast border around vysokopillya. the russian defense ministry and russian milbloggers claimed that russian forces are continuing to strike ukrainian military equipment in pravdyne (around 30km northwest of kherson city). [17] the ukrainian general staff also noted that russian forces shelled pravdyne. [18] geolocated footage showed ukrainian forces striking russian military equipment in davydiv brid. [19] ukraine’s southern operational command noted that ukrainian forces destroyed russian drones when they were conducting aerial reconnaissance over kostyrka (southeast of vysokopillya) and novodmytrivka on the eastern bank of the inhulets river along the t2207 highway. [20] an uptick in russian aerial reconnaissance in these areas may indicate that russian forces have shifted forces away from this sector of the front. russian main effort—eastern ukraine russian subordinate main effort—donetsk oblast (russian objective: capture the entirety of donetsk oblast, the claimed territory of russia’s proxies in donbas) russian forces continued ground attacks on the eastern outskirts of bakhmut and against avdiivka and continued routine fire along the frontline in donetsk oblast on september 21. [21] the ukrainian general staff reported that ukrainian forces repelled russian attacks against vesele, just northeast of soledar; zaitseve and kurdyumivka, south of bakhmut; and bakhmutske, northeast of bakhmut. [22] geolocated footage confirmed ukrainian forces maintain positions on the eastern outskirts of bakhmut, reportedly on the grounds of the champagne wine factory. [23] the ukrainian general staff reported that russian forces shelled but did not inflict any damage against the slovyansk thermal power plant, likely as part of russia’s continuing campaign to degrade ukrainian critical infrastructure. [24] russian forces conducted airstrikes against infrastructure facilities in bakhmut, indicating that ukrainian forces still hold fortified positions in the city. [25] russian forces conducted routine shelling in western donetsk oblast and eastern zaporizhia oblast, and additional russian forces deployed to the zaporizhia oblast frontline. ukraine’s general staff reported continued shelling along the frontline in the area. [26] the russian ministry of defense (mod) claimed that ukrainian forces conducted a failed ground attack near pavlivka, just north of vuhledar. [27] a russian source claimed that russian forces are conducting artillery strikes on an unspecified road towards vodyane, likely either the t0524 or t0509 highway or the slavne-vodyane road. [28] the russian source also claimed that ukrainian forces are deploying large quantities of equipment in the vuhledar direction, though isw cannot independently confirm this report. [29] a ukrainian source stated that elements of the russian 42nd motorized rifle division are deployed on the zaporizhia oblast frontline and that several armored personnel carriers of the 35th and 74th motorized rifle brigades traveled through rozivka, zaporizhia oblast, likely to positions along the front line. [30] supporting effort—southern axis (russian objective: maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against ukrainian strikes) russian forces did not conduct any ground assaults in western zaporizhia oblast and continued routine fire against ukrainian frontline positions and rear areas in mykolaiv oblast on september 21. [31] official ukrainian sources reported that russian forces struck unspecified infrastructure facilities in zaporizhzhia city, zaporizhia oblast; synelnykove raion, dnipropetrovsk oblast; and shevchenkove and ochakiv, mykolaiv oblast. [32] the ukrainian general staff reported on september 21 that ukrainian strikes inflicted severe casualties on russian forces in zaporizhia oblast on september 19, including killing 50 personnel and destroying 15 units of military equipment and an ammunition depot in the melitopol and polohy administrative districts as well as in the area of kamianka. [33] russian and ukrainian sources traded accusations of striking the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (znpp) on september 21, damaging one of the power units. ukrainian state nuclear agency energoatom stated that russian shelling damaged the communication equipment and a transformer for reactor number 6. [34] energoatom reported that the damaged transformer cut power to the reactor, forcing two emergency diesel generators to kick in to provide power to the reactor’s cooling pumps. znpp employees reportedly enabled an alternate power supply and shut down the emergency generators within an hour of the attack. the russian ministry of defense claimed that a ukrainian large-caliber projectile damaged a water pipe of reactor number 5’s safety system and shelling damaged a power line to reactor number 6. [35] an image circulated by social media users on september 21 shows a burst water pipe at the znpp near the reactor buildings. [36] russian forces continued routine fire against ukrainian positions on the opposite side of the kakhovka reservoir from enerhodar. [37] russian and ukrainian sources reported explosions in the black sea near sevastopol, crimea on september 21. [38] the russian-appointed occupation governor of sevastopol, mikhail razvozhayev stated that russian authorities discovered an unmanned water surface vehicle on soldatskyi beach and detonated the vehicle, causing the explosion. [39] mobilization and force generation efforts (russian objective: expand combat power without conducting general mobilization) russian federal subjects (regions) are continuing crypto-mobilization efforts regardless of russian president vladimir putin’s declaration of partial mobilization on september 21. novosibirsk oblast governor andrey travnikov announced that the oblast will form one or two more volunteer battalions if necessary for the russian special military operation in ukraine. [40] the ukrainian general staff added that the ”self-mobilization” campaign is ongoing simultaneously with partial mobilization, noting that cossacks are recruiting candidates to serve in rosgvardia. [41] the ukrainian general staff added that the kuban cossack army is forming additional volunteer units and training them at the cossack bases in krasnodar krai. the ukrainian general staff also noted that russian forces are misleading men into entering military service by offering them “construction” jobs in ukraine. russian federal subjects will likely continue advertising volunteer service and promising large bonus payments to incentivize more men to volunteer for contract service rather than waiting to be mobilized. russian forces are also continuing to replenish personnel with prisoner recruits and forcibly mobilized men from proxy areas. the ukrainian general staff reported that russian forces are still detaining men of conscription age in occupied luhansk and donetsk oblast. [42] the ukrainian main military intelligence directorate (gur) stated that russian forces established a training camp in occupied torez (about 62km due east of donetsk city) for russian prisoners. [43] the gur added that russian forces also began to recruit prisoners serving time in the donetsk people’s republic (dnr) into the dnr 100th separate motorized rifle brigade and “somali” battalion as well as the russian 9th separate motorized rifle regiment. the gur noted that recruiters select prisoners based on their physical characteristics and previous military experience, regardless of the severity of their crimes. the dnr leadership also reportedly revoked previously issued exemptions from mobilization and is continuing to mobilize industrial workers for combat service. activity in russian-occupied areas (russian objective: consolidate administrative control of occupied areas; set conditions for potential annexation into the russian federation or some other future political arrangement of moscow’s choosing) russian-appointed occupation administrators are likely increasing law enforcement and filtration measures in occupied areas of ukraine to maintain control of ukrainian populations and preempt partisan attacks ahead of russia’s sham annexation referenda, currently scheduled for september 23-27. [44] the ukrainian head of kherson oblast, yaroslav yanushevich, stated on september 21 that russian forces are escalating filtration measures and inspections of private property throughout occupied kherson oblast. [45] russian-backed authorities have also increased restrictions on movement out of occupied territories, likely to prevent large portions of the population in occupied territory from fleeing to ukrainian-held territory ahead of russia’s illegal annexation of occupied ukrainian territory and russian “partial mobilization.” ukrainian mariupol mayoral advisor petro andryushchenko claimed that the russian-backed commandant’s office in mariupol will stop issuing passes to civilians who wish to leave occupied parts of donetsk oblast on october 1. [46] andryushchenko also noted that russian forces at the checkpoint in vasylivka, zaporizhia oblast, are introducing special passes and increased restrictions for those who want to leave occupied zaporizhia oblast.

pm et click here to see isw’s interactive map of the russian invasion of ukraine. this map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report. a large-scale explosion damaged the kerch strait bridge that links occupied crimea with russia on october 8. maxar satellite imagery shows that the explosion collapsed one lane of the road bridge and damaged the nearby railway track.[1] the russian investigative committee stated that a truck exploded on the bridge and ignited seven fuel tanks on the railroad.[2] a small fraction of russian milbloggers speculated that ukrainian saboteurs used a boat to detonate the bridge from the sea, though there is no visible evidence for such a conclusion.[3] the kremlin refrained from accusing ukraine of sabotage or attack, echoing similar restraint following the sinking of the cruiser moskva and the ukrainian strike on saky airfield in crimea.[4] ukraine did not claim responsibility for the incident, but the new york times reported that an unnamed senior ukrainian official stated that ukrainian intelligence participated in the explosion.[5] kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov noted that the russian president vladimir putin ordered a government commission composed of government officials, security services, and the ministry of emergency situations to investigate the ”emergency.”[6] the explosion will not permanently disrupt critical russian ground lines of communication (glocs) to crimea, but its aftermath is likely to increase friction in russian logistics for some time. the road bridge appears at least partially operational, and the railroad bridge did not suffer significant structural damage according to russian reports that generally seem plausible based on the available video evidence. russian footage shows people walking on the damaged road bridge and a train moving on the railroad bridge.[7] the head of occupied crimea sergey aksyonov claimed that the remaining lane of the road bridge opened to cars and buses after a rigorous security check, but that trucks must move by ferry.[8] the collapsed lane of the road bridge will restrict russian military movements until it is repaired, forcing some russian forces to rely on the ferry connection for some time. russian forces will likely still be able to transport heavy military equipment via the railroad. russian officials will likely intensify security checks on all vehicles crossing the bridge, however, adding delays to the movement of russian military equipment, personnel, and supplies to crimea. putin has already signed a decree strengthening the security protocol on the bridge under the supervision of the russian federal security service (fsb).[9] the kremlin is likely continuing to frame the russian ministry of defense (mod) as the scapegoat for the kerch bridge explosion and other russian military failures to deflect the blame from putin. the russian mod has not issued an official statement regarding the incident as of this publication.[10] russian opposition outlet meduza reported that the russian presidential administration sent out a guide to russian mass media on the appropriate way to downplay the severity of the damage to the bridge, and it is possible that the kremlin has ordered the russian mod to remain quiet regarding the situation.[11] russian propagandist vladimir solovyov stated that russia must initiate a strike campaign on critical ukrainian infrastructure instead of listening to russian mod promises.[12] some nationalist voices noted that putin and his close circle are failing to immediately address the attack on the symbolic bridge, voicing direct criticism of putin for the first time. a milblogger warned that if putin fails to undertake retaliatory actions it “will be mistaken for the weakness of the president himself.”[13] another milblogger noted that it is hypocritical for the kremlin to call on russians to rally behind putin if he is unable to comment on significant events such as the moskva sinking, prisoner exchanges including azovstal fighters, or the collapse of the kharkiv frontline.[14] others criticized the silence of russian deputy chairman of the security council dmitry medvedev regarding the explosion, given that medvedev had made several statements defining any attacks on the kerch bridge as a violation of russian ”red lines.”[15] russian milbloggers and propagandists alike called on the kremlin to resume strikes on ukrainian infrastructure and notably did not make any calls for russia to use tactical nuclear weapons against ukraine. ukrainian and russian sources claimed that the kremlin targeted some higher military command figures following the kerch bridge explosion, but these reports remain unverified as of this publication. the ukrainian main military intelligence directorate (gur) reported that the kremlin detained, arrested, and blocked unspecified military officials and ordered the units of the elite dzerzhinsky separate operation purpose division to enter moscow on october 8.[16] milbloggers who favor the wagner group claimed that the kremlin has replaced russian defense minister sergey shoigu and chief of general staff army general valery gerasimov supposedly with tula governor alexey dyumin and the deputy commander-in-chief of the ground forces, lieutenant general alexander matovnikov, respectively.[17] isw cannot independently verify either of these reports at this time. the kremlin named the russian commander of the aerospace forces, army general sergey surovikin, the new commander of the russian operation in ukraine, and this appointment has generated positive feedback within the nationalist community. sorovikin previously commanded the “southern” group of forces in ukraine and was reportedly responsible for the capture of lysychansk in july.[18] milbloggers shared their excitement regarding surovikin’s appointment, noting that surovikin has the “tough” character necessary to regain the initiative in ukraine.[19] wagner financier yevgeniy prigozhin extravagantly praised surovikin because he “got into a tank and rushed to save” the soviet union during the 1991 coup attempt in moscow.[20] prigozhin’s interview further confirmed reports of a fissure between pro-war and “liberal” factions within the kremlin, which isw will consider in more detail in subsequent reports. key takeaways a large-scale explosion seriously damaged the kerch strait bridge that links occupied crimea with russia. the kremlin named the russian commander of the aerospace forces, army general sergey surovikin, the new commander of the russian operation in ukraine, and this appointment has generated positive feedback within the nationalist community. russian sources claimed that ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in kharkiv and luhansk oblasts. russian forces continued establishing defensive positions in northern kherson oblast. russian forces continued to attack settlements around bakhmut, avdiivka, and west of donetsk city. ukrainian forces reportedly continued to shoot down iranian-made shahed-136 drones. russian federal subjects are facing financial challenges in funding mobilization. russian and occupation administration officials continued measures to remove ukrainian children from their homes in russian-occupied territories. we do not report in detail on russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. we will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in ukrainian urban areas. we utterly condemn these russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, geneva conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports. ukrainian counteroffensives—southern and eastern ukraine russian main effort—eastern ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and two supporting efforts); russian subordinate main effort—capture the entirety of donetsk oblast russian supporting effort—southern axis russian mobilization and force generation efforts activities in russian-occupied areas ukrainian counteroffensives (ukrainian efforts to liberate russian-occupied territories) eastern ukraine: (oskil river-kreminna line) russian sources claimed that ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations from kharkiv oblast in the direction of svatove on october 8. the russian ministry of defense (mod) claimed that russian forces repelled ukrainian assaults southeast of kupyansk.[21] the head of the kharkiv oblast administration, oleg synehubov, reported that russian forces continued to shell kupyansk and surrounding settlements.[22] russian forces continued routine artillery, air, and missile strikes in eastern ukraine in the vicinity of kharkiv city, bohodukhiv, and near izyum.[23] russian sources also claimed that ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in the kreminna direction on october 8. the russian mod claimed that russian forces repelled ukrainian forces attempting to cross the zherebets river at an unspecified location.[24] the donetsk people’s republic (dnr) people’s militia claimed that russian forces maintain full control over the kreminna-svatove highway, despite previous reports of ukrainian forces operating in the area.[25] the russian mod also claimed that russian airstrikes hit two ukrainian concentrations of manpower south of kreminna near siversk and west of kreminna near yampilivka.[26] the russian mod is increasingly including tactical details about ukrainian forces in its claims, likely in response to russian milblogger criticism that they do not report enough on ukrainian advances. isw makes no attempt to evaluate the veracity of the details the russian mod presents about the sizes, echelons, designations, or types of ukrainian units and will not present those details in our reports. ukrainian sources reported that russian forces are continuing to suffer personnel losses in luhansk oblast. the ukrainian general staff reported on october 8 that russian forces transported 300 wounded personnel to a hospital in luhansk oblast.[27] southern ukraine: (kherson oblast) russian forces continued establishing defensive positions in kherson oblast on october 8. ukraine’s southern operational command reported that russian forces continued to shell areas along the line of contact to prevent ukrainian advances and began establishing new defensive lines in the beryslav and nova kakhovka raions.[28] a russian source claimed that ukrainian forces are continuing to consolidate along the front line near davydiv brid and mala oleksandrivka and are equipping strongholds in bezimenne, all near the ukrainian bridgehead over the inhulets river.[29] isw does not attempt to validate russian forecasts of possible ukrainian operations and offers no comment on their plausibility. ukrainian and russian sources reported ongoing battles north and northwest of kherson city, near the ukrainian bridgehead over the inhulets river, and northeast of beryslav on october 8. the ukrainian general staff reported that ukrainian forces repelled a russian ground attack near ternovy pody, roughly 20km northwest of kherson city.[30] ukraine’s southern operational command reported that russian forces unsuccessfully attempted to advance in the area of davydiv brid and mala oleksandrivka near the ukrainian bridgehead over the inhulets river.[31] the russian ministry of defense (mod) claimed that russian forces repelled ukrainian attempts to advance near sukhanove, pyatikhatki, sadok, ishchenka, burskynske, shchaslyve, and mala seidemynykha on the northern kherson oblast frontline.[32] a russian source claimed that russian forces retook pravdyne, 33km northwest of kherson city.[33] a russian source claimed that russian forces repelled a ukrainian ground attack near dudchany on the western bank of the dnipro river.[34] the donetsk people’s republic (dnr) claimed that russian forces maintain positions in snihurivka, mykolaiv oblast, approximately 60km east of mykolaiv city, and reported ongoing fighting on the outskirts of the settlement.[35] ukrainian forces continued their interdiction campaign in kherson oblast to support their southern counteroffensive on october 8. ukraine’s southern operational command reported that ukrainian forces struck three russian concentrations of manpower and equipment and a logistics point in beryslav raion.[36] ukraine's southern operational command also reported that ukrainian aviation struck russian anti-aircraft systems in beryslav and kakhovka raions.[37] geolocated images show that ukrainian forces likely hit five fuel storage facilities near kyselivka, bilozerskyi raion.[38] ukrainian forces reportedly shot down a russian orlan-10 drone in chervone, beryslav raion.[39] the russian mod claimed that land and maritime logistics routes are continuously provisioning russian forces operating in the mykolaiv-kryvyi rih and zaporizhia directions, however.[40] russian main effort—eastern ukraine russian subordinate main effort—donetsk oblast (russian objective: capture the entirety of donetsk oblast, the claimed territory of russia’s proxies in donbas) russian forces continued conducting ground attacks throughout donetsk oblast on october 8. the ukrainian general staff reported that ukrainian forces repelled russian ground attacks on and around bakhmut near vyimka, bilohorivka, bakhmutske, and krasna hora to the north and mayorsk, ozeryanivka, zaitseve, odradivka, and andriivka to the south.[41] a russian milblogger referred to recent russian-claimed gains south of bakhmut of zaitseve and vesela dolyna as a “tactical success.”[42] isw first reported on russian ground attacks against zaitseve and vesela dolyna on august 5 and july 13 respectively, noting that russian forces have taken over two months to be able to claim to have secured two small villages.[43] the ukrainian general staff also reported that ukrainian forces repelled russian ground assaults around avdiivka near pervomaiske, vesele, kamianka, and nevelske, and in western donetsk oblast near pobieda, krasnohorivka, and novomykhailivka.[44] the russian ministry of defense (mod) claimed that russian forces repelled a ukrainian counterattack at an unspecified location in the “south donetsk” direction, possibly referring to the vuhledar, western donetsk oblast area, but there is currently no independent confirmation of the russian mod’s definition of this operational direction.[45] ukrainian forces likely conducted strikes against railway stations in the russian rear in donetsk oblast on october 8. the dnr claimed that ukrainian forces struck a railway station in ilovaisk, donetsk oblast, damaging three diesel fuel tanks for trains and a technical area of the station.[46] russian sources claimed that ukrainian forces struck the karan railway station in andriivka, donetsk oblast, roughly 51km north of mariupol.[47] geolocated footage shows smoke rising from the station area with audible secondary detonations, likely from ammunition.[48] supporting effort—southern axis (russian objective: maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against ukrainian strikes) russian forces continued to conduct routine artillery, air, and missile strikes west of hulyaipole and in dnipropetrovsk and mykolaiv oblasts on october 8.[49] ukrainian sources reported that russian forces attacked zaporizhzhia city, mykolaiv city, ochakiv, and areas of odesa oblast with shahed-136 kamikaze drones but stated that ukrainian forces successfully shot them down.[50] russian forces continued artillery fire and drone strikes against infrastructure in nikopol and marhanets, dnipropetrovsk oblast, on the north bank of the dnipro river.[51] the ukrainian general staff reported that ukrainian forces shelled russian manpower and equipment concentrations in the areas of polohy and tokmak, zaporizhia oblast, and that russian forces suffered at least 85 casualties.[52] russian and ukrainian sources traded accusations of shelling the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (znpp) overnight on october 7-8.[53] russian and ukrainian officials and the international atomic energy agency stated that the shelling cut off the external energy supply to the znpp after engineers had just restored the external power line on october 7.[54] ukrainian enerhodar mayor dmytro orlov later stated that engineers restored power to enerhodar and the surrounding settlements on october 8.[55] russian zaporizhia oblast occupation official vladimir rogov stated that russian atomic energy agency rosatom has already started the process of integrating the znpp into the russian power grid.[56] mobilization and force generation efforts (russian objective: expand combat power without conducting general mobilization) the financial, logistical, and political challenges of supporting the russian mobilization process continue to fuel societal division within russia and criticism of the government. the kremlin and russian ministry of defense (mod) risk alienating core supporters including those supportive of mobilization by failing to address inconsistencies and inadequacies in the implementation of mobilization. the large-scale removal of russian men of working age (either through mobilization or through their flight) has left holes in the positions they formerly filled. a russian source reported on october 6 that the russian ministry of natural resources proposed to exempt garbage collectors and garbage truck drivers from mobilization.[57] forbes reported on october 6 that russian sports centers again petitioned authorities for an exemption to mobilization for coaches and instructors, as mobilization applies to 70% of men employed in the industry.[58] mothers caring for children after the mobilization of their husbands will also face greater non-work demands on their time. a russian source reported on october 6 that the liberal democratic party drafted a bill authorizing the reduction of work hours for mothers with mobilized husbands to 35 hours a week at prior salaries.[59] russian authorities appear to have recognized and attempted to address labor shortages caused by mobilization. the ukrainian general staff reported on october 8 that local authorities in some russian districts are attempting to implement mobilization plans drawing on unemployed men of conscription age.[60] however, the economic gaps left by the sudden removal of part of the russian workforce are likely to continue to create complications. funding mobilization poses an economic challenge to russian regions, as isw has previously reported.[61] russian regions balance pressure to deliver on promises to the mobilized while remaining within their means. a local russian source reported on october 6 that tartarstan deputy finance minister gela gerasimova stated that the budget of tartarstan cannot finance mobilization. gerasimova claimed mobilization will draw on the federal budget.[62] omsk governor aleksandr burkov stated on october 7 that he found an unspecified way to pay each mobilized person 100,000 rubles ($1,603) after previously stating the region's budget could not afford such payments.[63] the costs of mobilization are likely to continue well into 2023, and the long-term viability of such solutions is questionable. poor behavior demonstrated by conscripts brought to training grounds has disturbed nearby communities. a russian source reported on october 7 that residents of mulino raised complaints that the mobilized sent to mulino training grounds drank heavily and walked around the village. isw has previously reported similar complaints in this area.[64] nizhny novgorod governor gleb nikitin has therefore banned the sale of alcohol during mobilization in mulino.[65] reports from october 6 and 7 show a series of women across russia recording video messages asking for help in response to their husbands’ illegal mobilization.[66] isw has previously reported an ongoing pattern of mobilization of russians with disqualifying health and personal circumstances.[67] fontanka saint petersburg reported on october 6 that a housewife in krasnogvardeysky district, saint petersburg, received a mobilization notice.[68] this report is the first that isw has identified detailing the mobilization of a woman without mention of a relevant work background. mobilized soldiers also continue to face extreme conditions. a russian news source counted 15 deaths among the mobilized from various regions prior to deployment to ukraine as of october 7.[69] discrepancies in the level of public concern for newly mobilized units as compared to contract soldiers have likely created a rift in russian society. ukraine’s main military intelligence directorate (gur) published on october 8 a recording of a call between a contract russian soldier and his mother. the mother complained that mobilized units face preferential treatment over volunteer and contract soldiers who have been fighting for months. the mother argued that russian contract soldiers purchased their own equipment and faced the same difficulties as newly mobilized soldiers while the russian public did not care in the same way that they do about the mobilized men. she also noted that contract soldiers faced such difficulties without the 200,000-300,000-ruble ($3,207-4,811) bonus received by the mobilized. the mother directly expressed discontent with the apparent unreachability of putin on issues related to soldiers’ well-being and questioned whether he “even [knows] where our guys are?”[70] isw cannot confirm the extent of such dissatisfaction, but the increasing concessions given to mobilized men in response to broad criticism of the mobilization effort could increase such feelings among contract soldiers, volunteer soldiers, and their families. deputy russian minister of defense viktor goremykin deflected criticism that the russian ministry of defense (mod) is severely undersupplying soldiers by claiming on october 7 that the russian armed forces “have everything necessary to provide for every servicemember in full.”[71] widespread reports of russian mobilized units being forced to purchase their own equipment and clothing, going for days with no food or water, and requesting donations from russian society contradict goremykin’s statement.[72] russian military bloggers publicly mocked goremykin’s false claim and marveled at the ability of the russian mod to continue denying obvious logistical problems. one russian military blogger claimed that the russian mod prioritizes “attempts to create an external gloss” above the lives of soldiers and above the need to win.[73] another military blogger stated that it is no longer possible to replace reality with beautiful reports.[74] blatantly false claims decrease general belief in the credibility of the russian mod and contribute to the growing narrative of mod incompetence. russian authorities appear to be avoiding prosecution of men avoiding military summonses. russian lawyer pavel chikov posted to telegram on october 7 that the penza prosecutor’s office canceled the first criminal case for evasion of mobilization under article 328 of the russian criminal code after launching the case two days before.[75] federation council committee on constitutional legislation and state building head andrey klishas stated on october 7 that it is unlawful to threaten citizens with criminal liability under article 328 for refusal to mobilize.[76] such responses could represent a response to public pressure or challenges in prosecuting all mobilization dodgers. they could also represent the desire to try mobilization dodgers under alternative articles or continue attempts to force dodgers to mobilize rather than sit in prison. activity in russian-occupied areas (russian objective: consolidate administrative control of occupied and annexed areas; forcibly integrate ukrainian civilians into russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems) russian and occupation administration officials continued to increase filtration and law enforcement measures in russian-occupied territories on october 8. the ukrainian resistance center reported on october 8 that russian forces continue filtration activities near positions struck by ukrainian forces to find suspected ukrainian partisans that they believe to be providing ukrainian forces with the positions of russian manpower and equipment concentrations.[77] russian media reported that russian forces in russian-occupied melitopol have increased street inspections of residents’ documents.[78] the ukrainian resistance center reported that russian and occupation administration officials launched a telegram chatbot for reports on the location of ukrainian partisans in the russian-occupied territories.[79] the center also reported that russian federal security service (fsb) personnel increasingly question residents in filtration centers about their participation in the annexation referenda that were held in russian-occupied territories in late september.[80] mayor of melitopol ivan fedorov claimed that occupation administration officials are deporting residents with pro-ukrainian sentiments and transporting them to the vasylivka border checkpoint, but that  russian forces are still not allowing residents to pass through into ukrainian-held zaporizhia oblast.[81] russian and occupation administration officials are likely to increase filtration and law enforcement activities as ukrainian counteroffensives progress. russian and occupation administration officials continued measures to remove ukrainian children from their homes in russian-occupied territories on october 8. the head of the kherson occupation administration vladimir saldo reported that russian-occupied crimea agreed to take over 5,000 children from kherson oblast “on vacation” and that 1,500 of those children have already arrived in crimea.[82] vladimir saldo also announced that the governors of krasnodar krai and stavropol krai stated that their administrations are ready to accept up to 10,000 children from kherson oblast. saldo did not specify a duration for such offers or “vacations.”[83] vladimir saldo stated that the children’s parents would be able to join their children in the territories to which they are sent.[84] note: isw does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on russian, ukrainian, and western reporting and social

download the pdf frederick w. kagan, kateryna stepanenko, and karolina hird april 23, 6:30 pm et russian forces continued offensive operations along multiple axes even as they completed moving reinforcements drawn from the retreat from kyiv into the east and continued redeploying some forces from mariupol to the north. the russians have not taken time to refit troops moving from kyiv or mariupol before recommitting them to combat operations. they are not pausing offensive operations to wait until they have concentrated overwhelming combat power, and they do not appear to be massing forces on a few decisive axes of advance. they are continuing the pattern of operations they have followed throughout the war: committing small collections of units to widely dispersed attacks along multiple axes and refusing to accept necessary operational pauses to set conditions for decisive operations. russian forces have thus far only committed a handful of battalion tactical groups (btgs) to offensive operations in their various sectors, however, and could still launch a massed offensive operation. we assess that such an operation is unlikely given observed patterns and the inherent limitations of available actual combat power in troops that have fought hard and suffered many casualties, as well as observed challenges with command-and-control at the regiment/brigade and division level. it is possible that the russians are addressing or attempting to address some of those challenges and will soon launch an offensive in a new and better-coordinated form, but it remains unlikely. the objectives of russian offensives around the izyum-donetsk city salient are unclear. russian forces may seek to reach the izyum-debaltseve road along two or more axes to encircle a large concentration of ukrainian forces and built-up areas. ukrainian officials suggested on april 23 that russian forces near rubizhne and popasna may seek to encircle the severodonetsk-lysychansk area rather than pursue the deeper envelopment. [1] it is too soon to evaluate the likelihood of this russian course of action or the probability of its success. key takeaways russian forces continued their pressure on the azovstal facility in mariupol. russian troops drawn from the retreat from kyiv are re-entering combat in eastern ukraine. russian forces from around mariupol are redeploying to the vicinity of donetsk city and are likely to enter combat again soon and without rest or refit. russia continued conducting small-scale ground offensives at multiple points along the front from izyum to zaporizhia oblast. we do not report in detail on russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. we will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in ukrainian urban areas. we utterly condemn these russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, geneva conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports. isw has updated its assessment of the four primary efforts russian forces are engaged in at this time: main effort—eastern ukraine (comprised of two subordinate supporting efforts); supporting effort 1—kharkiv and izyum; supporting effort 2—southern axis; supporting effort 3—sumy and northeastern ukraine. main effort—eastern ukraine subordinate main effort—mariupol (russian objective: capture mariupol and reduce the ukrainian defenders) russian forces continued to attack ukrainian defenders in the azovstal steel plant and are likely attempting to starve out those remaining within the facility. [2] advisor to the head of the ukrainian president’s office oleksiy arestovych stated that russian troops tried to storm the plant and “strangle” ukrainian resistance, though isw cannot independently verify this claim. [3] russian forces allegedly organized buses for civilian evacuation from mariupol but canceled the evacuation on the grounds that ukrainian ”nationalists” were planning on attacking the civilians. [4] such actions that spoil the evacuation process likely represent further attempts to shape the information space in mariupol and globally, as well as to extend administrative control in captured portions of the city. [5] subordinate main effort—donetsk and luhansk oblasts (russian objective: capture the entirety of donetsk and luhansk oblasts, the claimed territory of russia’s proxies in donbas) russian forces conducted limited ground offensives in rubizhne, popasna, and marinka on april 23 but did not make any significant territorial gains. [6] the ukrainian general staff said that russian forces are focusing on preparing to assault severodonetsk while continuing unsuccessful ground attacks in the direction of slovyansk and shelling settlements all along the frontline. [7] social media users and foreign journalists geolocated russian forces to the northeastern part of rubizhne, where street fighting continued as of april 23. [8] russian forces paused offensive operations on avdiivka, just north of donetsk city, after consistently targeting the settlement throughout the week. donetsk people’s republic (dnr) and russian units have reportedly been arriving in the vicinity of donetsk city from mariupol since april 21, and the russian command will likely recommit these degraded units to offensives in donetsk and luhansk oblasts. [9] supporting effort #1—kharkiv and izyum: (russian objective: advance southeast to support russian operations in luhansk oblast; defend ground lines of communication (glocs) to the izyum axis) russian forces conducted ground attacks from izyum on april 23. [10] arestovych said that russian troops seized lozove, approximately 35 km east of izyum, on april 23. [11] the ukrainian general staff reported that elements of the 35th combined arms army’s 1st tank army and the 68th army corps are participating in active combat in the area as of april 23. [12] the ukrainian general staff stated that elements of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade of the 35th combined arms army, which had fought in bucha, are operating in the vicinity of izyum. [13] elements of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade sustained losses while fighting on the kyiv axis earlier in the invasion, redeployed to the izyum axis quickly, and therefore likely add limited combat power to the fight. [14] russian forces maintained their positions northeast of kharkiv city and continued to shell surrounding areas on april 23. [15] reports of russian reinforcements from the kyiv axis in kharkiv oblast likely indicate that russia intends to maintain pressure on kharkiv city, contradicting the russian claim that moscow’s focus is on securing the borders of luhansk and donetsk oblasts. russian ground lines of communication (glocs) do not currently run through or even near kharkiv city, and the most recent ukrainian counteroffensives near the city are unlikely to threaten russian glocs from belgorod to izyum. supporting effort #2—southern axis: (russian objective: defend kherson against ukrainian counterattacks) russian forces continued a limited offensive in zaporizhia oblast but paused ground offensive operations in northern kherson oblast on april 23. [16] oleksiy arestovych, chief advisor to ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky, said that russian forces advanced several kilometers in the direction of hulyaipole, zaporizhia oblast, likely intending to stop ukrainian counteroffensives in the area or to secure the n15 highway. [17] the ukrainian general staff reported that one russian btg from the 19th motorized rifle division of the 58th combined arms army moved in the direction of zaporizhia. this unit was likely one of three sent to melitopol early in march and is not likely a fresh unit, although it may have had time to refit and replace losses. [18] russian forces are reportedly regrouping separate units of the 8th and 49th combined arms armies, the 22nd army corps, black sea coastal troops, and airborne troops to retain occupied frontiers in southern ukraine. [19] ukraine’s military intelligence directorate claimed that ukrainian forces struck a command post of the 49th combined arms army in an unspecified frontline location in southern ukraine on april 22, killing at least two generals and destroying the post. [20] isw cannot independently verify this strike or its casualties. the ukrainian resistance center also reported that an organized resistance movement has killed 100 russian occupation personnel since the start of the war, including 30 since april 12. [21] russian forces are attempting to forcibly mobilize residents of temporarily occupied settlements in kherson and zaporizhia oblasts, despite growing resistance movements. [22] supporting effort #3—sumy and northeastern ukraine: (russian objective: withdraw combat power in good order for redeployment to eastern ukraine) there was no significant change in this area in the past 24 hours. immediate items to watch russian forces will likely continue attacking southeast from izyum, west from kreminna and popasna, and north from donetsk city via avdiivka or another axis. russian forces will attempt to starve out the remaining defenders of the azovstal steel plant in mariupol and will not allow trapped civilians to evacuate. russian forces will likely increase the scale of ground offensive operations in the coming days, but it is too soon to tell how fast they will do so or how large those offensives will be. it is also too soon to assess how the russians will weight their efforts in the arc from izyum to donetsk city. correction: a previous version of this report stated that russian troops seized lozova, kharkiv oblast, approximately 100km west of izyum. russian troops actually seized lozove, donetsk oblast, approximately 35km east of izyum.    \n",

president vladimir putin celebrated the russian seizure of lysychansk and the luhansk oblast border and appeared to direct the russian military to conduct an operational pause. putin met with russian defense minister sergey shoigu on july 4 to discuss recent russian gains in luhansk oblast and presented colonel general alexander lapin and major general esedulla abachev with the “hero of russia” award for their leadership during the lysychansk operation. [1] putin and shoigu presented the capture of lysychansk and luhansk oblast as a major victory for russian forces in ukraine. putin also stated that the russian units that participated in the battle for lysychansk should rest to increase their combat capabilities. [2] putin‘s public comment was likely meant to signal his concern for the welfare of his troops in the face of periodic complaints in russia about the treatment of russian soldiers. his comment was also likely accurate—russian troops that fought through severodonetsk and lysychansk very likely do need a significant period in which to rest and refit before resuming large-scale offensive operations. it is not clear, however, that the russian military will accept the risks of a long enough operational pause to allow these likely exhausted forces to regain their strength. former russian military commander igor girkin, an ardent russian nationalist who commanded militants during the 2014 war in donbas, posted a scathing critique of the kremlin’s handling of the war on his telegram channel and questioned the significance of the seizure of lysychansk. he suggested that russian forces had paid too high a price for a limited gain. in a series of telegram posts published prior to putin’s meeting with shoigu on july 4, girkin complained that russian forces have failed to meet the announced goals of the “second stage of the special operation” (the operations in eastern ukraine following russia’s retreat from kyiv) to his nearly 400,000 subscribers. [3] girkin noted that the ukrainian defense of lysychansk was deliberately designed to inflict maximum damage on russian troops and burn through russian manpower and equipment. he strongly suggested that accepting battle on the ukrainians‘ terms was a significant misstep by the russian leadership. [4] girkin stated (before putin’s remarks were made public) that russian troops need time to rest and replenish in order to recover their offensive potential and noted that the lack of individual soldier replacements and unit rotations is severely degrading morale. he warned, however, that taking time to reconstitute offensive capability would allow ukrainian troops to seize the initiative and further threaten russian gains. [5] girkin additionally claimed that russian forces have limited prospects of advancing elsewhere in ukraine due to ukrainian personnel and equipment superiority. [6] girkin’s critique is a noteworthy example of the way russian milbloggers and military enthusiasts have become disillusioned with the kremlin’s handling and execution of operations in ukraine, particularly after the dramatic failed river crossing attempt at bilohorivka in early may. [7] girkin’s statements directly undermine the kremlin’s efforts to frame lysychansk as a significant victory or turning point and show that the disillusionment amongst ultra-nationalist elements in the russian information space continues to run deep. girkin’s assessment of russian military failures notably aligns with much of isw’s (and other western agencies’ and experts’) analysis, suggesting that he and some other milbloggers continue to make and publish assessments of the situation and forecasts independent of the kremlin line. girkin likely hopes to use his status as a prominent former participant in the war in donbas in 2014 to persuade putin to take certain measures to secure russian success in a war that girkin still thinks is justified and necessary—specifically mobilizing the russian population for war on a much larger scale. [8] girkin, along with other members of the russian nationalist milblogger space, will likely continue to offer critiques of the kremlin’s line on operations in ukraine to advocate for general mobilization and more competent russian military leadership. ukrainian forces are increasingly targeting russian military infrastructure with indirect fire and us-provided himars systems deep in occupied territory. ukrainian forces reportedly struck russian ammunition depots in dibrivne, kharkiv oblast, (close to the frontline) on july 4 and snizhne, donetsk oblast, (approximately 75 km from the frontlines) overnight on july 3-4 following a strike on one of four russian ammunition depots in melitopol on july 3. [9] the ukrainian general staff also published a video on july 4 of a ukrainian himars (high mobility artillery rocket system) operating in an unspecified area of zaporizhia oblast. [10] the increased ability of ukrainian forces to target critical russian military facilities with western-provided himars demonstrates how western military aid provides ukraine with new and necessary military capabilities. key takeaways russian leadership may be setting conditions for an operational pause following the seizure of lysychansk and the luhansk oblast boundary. russian forces are consolidating territorial and administrative control over severodonetsk and lysychansk. russian forces continued offensive operations to the east of bakhmut to prepare for advances on bakhmut and siversk. russian forces continued limited and unsuccessful assaults north of kharkiv city. ukrainian partisan activity is targeting russian railway lines around melitopol and tokmak. russian leadership may be setting conditions for the conscription of ukrainian citizens living in occupied territories. we do not report in detail on russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. we will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in ukrainian urban areas. we utterly condemn these russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, geneva conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports. main effort—eastern ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and three supporting efforts) subordinate main effort—encirclement of ukrainian troops in the cauldron between izyum and donetsk and luhansk oblasts supporting effort 1—kharkiv city supporting effort 2—southern axis mobilization and force generation efforts activities in russian-occupied areas main effort—eastern ukraine subordinate main effort—southern kharkiv, donetsk, luhansk oblasts (russian objective: encircle ukrainian forces in eastern ukraine and capture the entirety of donetsk and luhansk oblasts, the claimed territory of russia’s proxies in donbas) russian forces took measures to consolidate control of captured territory around severodonetsk and lysychansk on july 4. [11] the russian ministry of defense announced that russian forces completed the capture of luhansk oblast with the capture of lysychansk. [12] the ukrainian general staff reported that russian troops are fortifying their positions around lysychansk and bilohorivka. [13] severodonetsk mayor oleksandr stryuk also noted that russian forces are trying to establish an administrative presence in severodonetsk and have established a commandant’s office to replace the local government. [14] russian forces will likely begin to institute administrative occupational control over severodonetsk and lysychansk. russian forces continued offensive operations to the east of bakhmut on july 4 to prepare for subsequent offensive operations toward bakhmut and siversk. [15] the ukrainian general staff reported that russian forces conducted a reconnaissance in force on the outskirts of berestove and undertook offensive operations around the vuhledar power plant, vasylivka, spirne, klynove, and mayorsk. [16] russian forces will likely continue efforts to move west of the t1302 bakhmut-lysychansk highway to eventually drive on bakhmut and siversk, although their ability to do so successfully following losses sustained during attempts to take lysychansk is questionable. [17] nasa’s fire information for resource management system (firms) remotely sensed data showed fires near spirne, klynove, and the vuhledar power plant on july 4, consistent with the ukrainian general staff’s reports. [source: nasa’s fire information for resource management system, july 4] russian forces conducted limited ground assaults southwest of donetsk city to improve their tactical position in the donetsk city-avdiivka area on july 4. [18] the ukrainian general staff reported that russian forces conducted assaults in the direction of pobeda and mariinka, just southwest of donetsk city. russian forces have reportedly occupied the dominant heights surrounding novoselivka druha (10km northeast of avdiivka) and are using this position to exert fire control over avdiivka. [19] russian forces continued offensive operations northwest of slovyansk near the kharkiv-donetsk oblast border and made incremental gains on july 4. [20] the ukrainian general staff stated that russian forces had “partial success” in mazanivka, about 20 km northwest of slovyansk, and fought in bohorodychne and dolyna. [21] russian forces also reportedly redeployed a battalion tactical group (btg) from izyum to snizhkivka- just south of izyum in the direction of barvinkove, which may suggest that russian forces are preparing for renewed offensives southeast of izyum towards barvinkove. nasa firms data for july 4 showed large concentrations of heat anomalies in the wooded areas to the southeast of izyum indicating probable locations for russian indirect fire and ukrainian counterbattery fires. [source: nasa’s fire information for resource management system, july 4] supporting effort #1—kharkiv city (russian objective: defend ground lines of communication (glocs) to izyum and prevent ukrainian forces from reaching the russian border) russian forces did not make any territorial gains on the kharkiv city axis on july 4. ukrainian sources reported that ukrainian forces repelled russian assaults on prudyanka along the t2117 highway and sosnivka, less than 10 km from the russian border. [22] russian forces continued air, artillery, and rocket strikes on ukrainian military infrastructure and settlements north, northeast, and east of kharkiv city. [23] russian telegram channel rybar claimed that ukrainian forces conducted spoiling attacks, likely small reconnaissance in force operations, on russian positions near kozacha lopan, east of udy. [24] the ukrainian general staff reported that russian ground forces with aviation support on the kharkiv city axis are focusing on restraining any ukrainian offensive operations. [25] the russian defense ministry claimed that russian forces destroyed the temporary deployment points of the ukrainian 92nd mechanized and 40th artillery brigades in kharkiv city. [26] supporting effort #2—southern axis (russian objective: defend kherson and zaporizhia oblasts against ukrainian counterattacks) russian forces focused on regaining lost positions in northeastern kherson oblast on july 4. the ukrainian general staff reported russian attacks on ivanivka, potemkyne, and myrne. [27] russian forces reportedly deployed 17 railway wagons with ammunition from crimea to northern kherson oblast, likely to resupply russian artillery units. [28] nasa’s firms data showed abnormally high numbers of fires along the mykolaiv-kherson oblast frontline on july 4, indicating intense indirect fire attacks. russian and ukrainian forces continued shelling across the line of contact along the entire southern axis on july 4. [29] [source: nasa’s fire information for resource management system, july 4] [source: nasa’s fire information for resource management system, july 4] a ukrainian partisan campaign may be targeting russian rail lines near melitopol in zaporizhia oblast. the ukrainian resistance center reported that ukrainian partisans blew up a railway bridge near occupied lyubimivka between melitopol and tokmak, zaporizhia oblast on july 3, likely obstructing russian resupply efforts from crimea to the zaporizhia oblast front line. [30] ukrainian partisans derailed a separate russian armored train carrying ammunition near melitopol on july 2. [31] ukrainian partisans had previously targeted russian armored trains and locomotives in melitopol in late april and mid-may. [32] this pattern of reported activity may indicate a coordinated partisan campaign targeting russian rail lines. mobilization and force-generation efforts (russian objective: expand combat power without conducting general mobilization) russian leaders may be preparing to mobilize ukrainian citizens in occupied areas. the representative of the ukrainian president in crimea stated on july 3 that the russian administration in crimea issued a decree creating a “conscription commission for the mobilization of citizens in the republic of crimea,” which would allow russian authorities to forcibly mobilize residents of crimea to fight against ukraine. [33] while the status of crimea under russian federation law (but not under ukrainian or international law) is distinct from the areas of eastern and southern ukraine that have been occupied since february 24, this decree may set an internal russian precedent for russian authorities to begin forced mobilization campaigns throughout occupied parts of ukraine to support force generation efforts in the coming months. activity in russian-occupied areas (russian objective: consolidate administrative control of occupied areas; set conditions for potential annexation into the russian federation or some other future political arrangement of moscow’s choosing) russian authorities continued to set conditions for various annexation scenarios on july 4. director of ukraine’s main intelligence directorate (gur) kyrylo budanov stated that russia is preparing several annexation scenarios before september 11, the suggested date for the annexation of ukrainian territory into the russian federation. [34] budanov claimed that russia may be preparing to join ukrainian territories to russia, create one large ”people’s republic,” or annex individual territories to russia. the suggestion of a singular, large ”people’s republic” is novel and has not yet been discussed by ukrainian or russian authorities. a single ”people’s republic” likely indicates that the kremlin continues to hold territorial aspirations beyond the donbas.

et click here to see isw's interactive map of the russian invasion of ukraine. this map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report. ukrainian officials confirmed that russia is using iranian-provided drones in ukraine. advisor to the ukrainian president’s office, oleksiy arestovych, stated on august 5 that iran handed 46 drones over to russia and that the ukrainian government has already noted the use of these drones in combat in ukraine. [1] at least a portion of the provided drones are older-generation “shahed 129” heavy strike drones, which russian forces may seek to use to attack us-provided himars in ukraine. [2] it is unclear whether the 46 drones represent all the drones that tehran has agreed to send, or the number of iranian drones that are currently operating in ukraine. key takeaways ukrainian officials confirmed that russian forces are using iranian-provided drones in ukraine. russian forces conducted unsuccessful ground assaults on settlements south of bakhmut. russian and ukrainian forces exchanged heavy artillery fire in pisky, suggesting that russian forces are unlikely to have full control of pisky despite russian claims. russian forces conducted several limited ground assaults to the north, northwest, and southwest of donetsk city. russian and ukrainian forces accused each other of firing rounds near the zaporizhia nuclear power plant (npp) in enerhodar, but isw cannot independently determine which party is responsible for the incident. russian forces have repeatedly used artillery systems deliberately positioned within the complex to fire on targets across the dnipro river. russian forces unsuccessfully attempted to advance on lozove, kherson oblast, likely targeting the ukrainian bridgehead over the inhulets river. russian federal subjects are forming new volunteer battalions in omsk and samara oblasts. russian occupation authorities are likely accelerating passportization and rubleization efforts and civilian data collection in occupied territories in preparation for the upcoming pseudo-referenda on the annexation of occupied ukrainian territory into russia. the kremlin is continuing to replace ukrainian collaborators in russian occupation administrations with russian officials, likely to prepare for formal russian governance of annexed areas. we do not report in detail on russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. we will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in ukrainian urban areas. we utterly condemn these russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, geneva conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports. main effort—eastern ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and two supporting efforts); subordinate main effort—encirclement of ukrainian troops in the cauldron between izyum and donetsk and luhansk oblasts supporting effort 1—kharkiv city supporting effort 2—southern axis mobilization and force generation efforts activities in russian-occupied areas main effort—eastern ukraine subordinate main effort—southern kharkiv, donetsk, luhansk oblasts (russian objective: encircle ukrainian forces in eastern ukraine and capture the entirety of donetsk and luhansk oblasts, the claimed territory of russia’s proxies in donbas) russian forces did not conduct any confirmed ground attacks between izyum and slovyansk on august 5. the ukrainian general staff reported that russian forces shelled settlements along the kharkiv-donetsk oblast border northwest of slovyansk, including bohorodychne, dolyna, dibrivne, mazanivka, adamivka, and kurulka. [3] russian forces continued offensive operations in the siversk area on august 5. the ukrainian general staff stated that russian troops are engaged in small arms fire near siversk in addition to continued artillery strikes on siversk city and surrounding settlements. [4] russian forces conducted ground attacks south of bakhmut on august 5. the ukrainian general staff reported that russian troops unsuccessfully attempted to gain ground and improve their tactical positions in zaitseve and vershyna, both within 5km of the southern outskirts of bakhmut. [5] several russian milbloggers claimed that russian forces are actively fighting at the knauf gips donbas gypsum factory on the southeastern outskirts of soledar, about 8km northeast of bakhmut and directly along the t1302 bakhmut-lysychansk highway. [6] ukrainian sources stated that russian troops are struggling to get through ukrainian defenses surrounding bakhmut, and russian forces will likely continue to impale themselves on fortified ukrainian positions under the cover of heavy artillery fire without securing large gains rapidly. [7] russian forces conducted several limited ground attacks to the north and west of donetsk city on august 5. the ukrainian general staff stated that russian troops unsuccessfully attempted to advance towards krasnohorivka (15km north of donetsk city), avdiivka (about 6km north of donetsk city), and pisky (about 5km northwest of donetsk city). [8] despite claims made by russian sources that russian troops have taken complete control of pisky, geolocated videos from the area suggest that pisky remains under heavy artillery fire from all sides, which means that russian forces likely have not yet been able to actually establish full control of urban parts of pisky itself. [9] russian troops also unsuccessfully attempted to advance on marinka, directly on the southwestern outskirts of donetsk city. [10] luhansk people’s republic (lnr) deputy internal minister vitaly kiselev claimed that separate dnr brigades and wagner group forces took control of half of marinka. [11] while isw cannot independently confirm the status of block-to-block control of marinka, russian troops will likely attempt to advance through the town from positions in the petrovskyi district of donetsk city. supporting effort #1—kharkiv city (russian objective: defend ground lines of communication (glocs) to izyum and prevent ukrainian forces from reaching the russian border) russian forces continued to focus on preventing ukrainian forces from creating conditions to resume a counteroffensive on the kharkiv city axis on august 5. russian forces continued to conduct aerial reconnaissance and engage ukrainian forces in positional battles in settlements northwest of kharkiv city but did not make any territorial gains. [12] russian forces continued shelling kharkiv city and settlements to the northeast, northwest, and southeast. [13] supporting effort #2—southern axis (russian objective: defend kherson and zaporizhia oblasts against ukrainian counterattacks) russian forces continued to launch unsuccessful assaults in northwestern kherson oblast, likely targeting the ukrainian bridgehead over the inhulets river. ukrainian military officials reported that two russian platoon-sized units consisting of spetsnaz and tank elements unsuccessfully attempted to advance onto lozove, situated on the eastern inhulets river bank. [14] russian forces also continued to launch airstrikes near lozove, velyke artakove, and andiivka, all in the vicinity of the ukrainian bridgehead. [15] russian forces have also intensified aerial reconnaissance and maintained heavy artillery fire along the line of contact on the kherson oblast administrative border. [16] russian forces continued to target nikopol, mykolaiv city, dnipropetrovsk, and odesa oblasts with artillery, mlrs, and missile strikes on august 5. dnipropetrovsk oblast regional authorities reported that russian forces launched approximately 60 rockets from grad mlrs systems at nikopol’s civilian infrastructure and struck myrivska hromada (community district) with a kh-59 cruise missile. [17] mykolaiv oblast officials reported that russian forces shelled mykolaiv city with pion heavy artillery. [18] the ukrainian general staff also reported that russian forces launched a missile strike on unspecified infrastructure in mykolaivka on the odesa-mykolaiv oblast border. [19] russian and ukrainian officials accused each other of firing rounds near the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (npp) in enerhodar on august 5. ukrainian state nuclear power enterprise energoatom reported that russian forces conducted another artillery provocation and damaged three high-voltage communications lines of the zaporizhzhia npp autotransformer near the plant’s industrial site. [20] enerhodar mayor dmytro orlov also noted that russian forces shelled enerhodar’s residential neighborhoods from the direction of the zaporizhzhia npp, resulting in power outages in most neighborhoods. [21] russian occupation authorities in enerhodar claimed that ukrainian artillery shelled the territory of the zaporizhzhia npp, damaging two power lines that are necessary for the operation of power units in the city. [22] isw cannot independently determine which party is responsible for the incident, however, russian forces are likely continuing to use positions around the zaporizhzhia npp to shell nikopol just across the kakhovka reservoir. the uk defense ministry also assessed that russian forces are using facilities at the zaporizhzhia npp and in enerhodar city as a sanctuary in which to rest and protect their equipment from ukrainian strikes, given the protected status of the npp. [23] ukrainian forces likely continued to target russian ammunition depots and positions in kherson oblast. the ukrainian southern operational command reported destroying three russian ammunition depots in kherson city, and in prydniprovske and tokarivka (both situated east of kherson city along the dnipro river). [24] ukrainian telegram channel operativnyi zsu reported that ukrainian forces have struck two unspecified military infrastructure objects in oleshky and nova kakhovka with high-precision weapons. [25] ukrainian forces reportedly destroyed four russian s-300 air defense missile systems, and geolocated footage showed ukrainian missile units destroying russian armored personnel carriers in starosillya along the t2207 ground line of communication (glocs). [26] local social media users reported on and published footage suggesting that russian forces seized kherson city clinical hospital after ukrainian strikes on a russian base in kherson city in mid-july and are unloading military equipment in the building. [27] mobilization and force generation efforts ( russian objective: expand combat power without conducting general mobilization) russian sources confirmed the formation of the 3rd army corps on august 5. russian milblogger and military correspondent sasha kots announced recruitment for the “samara” volunteer battalion in samara oblast and noted that the battalion will join the 3rd army corps of the russian armed forces. [28] the battalion is recruiting men between the ages of 18 and 50 who have completed at least middle or high school education, without required prior military experience. [29] isw has previously reported that ukrainian officials believed that russian forces were forming a 15,500-person-strong 3 rd army corps within the western military district (wmd) based out of mulino, nizhny novgorod oblast, but did not have official confirmation of its formation from russian sources. [30] sasha kots’ announcement also indicates that the kremlin is likely planning to compose the 3rd army corps at least in part from volunteer battalions. russian federal subjects (regions) continued to form regionally-based volunteer battalions. omsk oblast governor aleksandr butkov reported on august 5 that omsk oblast is continuing to form three volunteer battalions - “irtysh,” “avangard,” and “om” - to deploy to donbas to provide engineering, medical and logistical support. [31] butkov stated that omsk oblast will provide a one-time payment of 100,000 rubles (approximately $1,612) to recruits but specified that the funds will only be accessible after three months of service.[32] omsk oblast news outlet bk55 reported that recruits will receive a monthly salary is 40,000 to 50,000 (approximately $661-$826) which will increase to 130,000 (approximately $2,147) once they enter the territory of ukraine. [33] russian forces continued to face low morale issues within its federal republics. russian telegram channel rybar stated that the akbuzat movement (a human rights activism movement) in the russian republic of bashkortostan is calling on bashkortostan servicemen to terminate their contracts with the russian armed forces.[34] rybar reported that akbuzat leadership is offering legal assistance to those who break their contracts. rybar condemned the movement and accused the akbuzat leadership of sharing the personal data of applicants with third-parties, including the security service of ukraine (sbu).[35] activity in russian-occupied areas (russian objective: consolidate administrative control of occupied areas; set conditions for potential annexation into the russian federation or some other future political arrangement of moscow’s choosing) russian occupation authorities are dramatically expanding their passportization of occupied ukrainian territories by requiring ukrainian civilians to acquire russian passports to participate in basic life activities. occupation authorities are also increasingly requiring the use of the russian ruble rather than the ukrainian hryvnia and will likely begin levying russian taxes on ukrainian residents of occupied areas. ukraine’s main military intelligence directorate (gur) reported on august 5 that russian occupation authorities in melitopol are forcing ukrainian tenants who rent plots of agricultural land to negotiate new rental agreements, even if their agreements remain active. [36] renegotiation of their rental agreements requires a russian passport. the gur also reported that russian occupation authorities are requiring all ukrainian vehicle license plates to transfer to temporary russian-style license plates and to re-register their vehicles in a russian system. re-registration will require a russian passport. the gur also reported that the russian-appointed minister of agrarian policy for kherson oblast, ukrainian collaborator oleksii kovalev, ordered kherson farmers to register their businesses and pay taxes under russian law. the gur also reported that russian authorities sent letters to businesspeople and self-employed residents of kamianske, zaporizhia oblast requesting that they register their businesses and begin paying russian taxes. registration of business activity will require a russian passport. the ukrainian advisor to the kherson oblast military administration, serhiy khlan, reported on august 4 that russian occupation forces began to detain civilians for trying to exchange rubles to hryvnias in kherson oblast and began making pension payments in rubles to accelerate the forced rubleization of the occupied economy. [37] pensioners hoping to collect their pensions are required to provide their personal information to occupation authorities. khlan also reported that russian forces require ukrainian civilians who wish to have internet or cell phone access to provide their passports and personal information to authorities. ukrainian telegram channel mariupol now reported that residents must bring their passports with them to register to vote in the annexation referenda. [38] the ukrainian mayor of enerhodar, zaporizhia oblast, dmytro orlov, said that russian authorities are using the records of utility companies and the passport information of pensioners to build a database of ukrainian civilian information to falsify the results of the planned pseudo-referenda on accession into rusia. [39] orlov speculated that russian forces are rushing to implement the referenda because ”they are well aware they have almost no time left.” voter registration for russia’s annexation pseudo-referenda in occupied ukraine will likely pose an impossible choice to pro-ukrainian residents, who will need to provide identification to register to vote that can then be used to falsify or disregard their votes. the forced russian passportization of occupied areas and the mass collection of residents’ data will enable occupying forces to better monitor dissent and votes and could allow russian authorities to target and penalize any ukrainian who votes against russia’s annexation, as isw previously reported. [40] russian occupation authorities could also confiscate ukrainian passports, making it more difficult for ukrainian civilians to flee occupied areas. meanwhile, the kremlin is continuing to replace ukrainian collaborators in occupation administrations with russian officials, likely to prepare for formal russian governance of annexed areas. russian authorities replaced the head of the kherson oblast civil-military administration, ukrainian collaborator vladimir saldo, with russian deputy head of kaliningrad oblast sergey yeliseyev on august 4. yeliseyev was an employee of the russian federal security service (fsb) from 1993-2005.[41] saldo announced that he was leaving his position to seek medical treatment after consultations with colleagues and doctors. russian sources reported that he suffered from a form of nervous exhaustion after complications from covid-19, while the russian outlet baza and various ukrainian partisan sources suggested he had been poisoned and was in a medically induced coma.[42] ukrainian partisan channel zalizna palianytsia boasted that the ”fate of the traitors has been decided in advance;” either ukrainian partisans will kill them, or russians will poison them.[43]    \n",

This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.</strong></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement of “partial mobilization” on September 21 reflected many problems Russia faces in its faltering invasion of Ukraine that Moscow is unlikely to be able to resolve in the coming months.</strong><strong>[1]</strong><strong> </strong>Putin’s order to mobilize part of Russia’s “trained” reserve, that is, individuals who have completed their mandatory conscript service, will not generate significant usable Russian combat power for months. It may suffice to sustain the current levels of Russian military manpower in 2023 by offsetting Russian casualties, although even that is not yet clear. It will occur in deliberate phases, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said in an interview on September 21, likely precluding any sudden influx of Russian forces that could dramatically shift the tide of the war.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[2]</span> Russia’s partial mobilization will thus not deprive Ukraine of the opportunity to liberate more of its occupied territory into and through the winter.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Putin and Shoigu emphatically said that only reservists who have completed their initial military service will be mobilized, making clear that Russia will not be expanding conscription. </strong>Shoigu also declared that students will not be affected and told them to go about their studies without concern.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[3]</span>  These comments were clearly intended to allay fears among the Russian population that “partial mobilization” was code for general conscription.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>It is not clear how much of the Russian reserve has already been deployed to fight in Ukraine. </strong>Western intelligence officials reportedly said in November 2021 that Russia had called up “tens of thousands of reservists” as part of its pre-war mobilization.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[4]</span> Ukrainian military officials reported in June 2022 that Russian forces had committed 80,000 members of the mobilized reserve to fight in Ukraine.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[5]</span> The Russian military likely called up the most combat-ready reserves in that pre-war mobilization effort, which suggests that the current partial mobilization will begin by drawing on less combat-ready personnel from the outset.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Russian reserves are poorly trained to begin with and receive no refresher training once their conscription period is completed. </strong>Russian mandatory military service is only one year, which gives conscripts little time to learn how to be soldiers, to begin with. The absence of refresher training after that initial period accelerates the degradation of learned soldier skills over time. Shoigu referred to the intent of calling up reservists with “combat experience,” but very few Russian reservists other than those now serving in Ukraine have any combat experience.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[6]</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Reports conflict regarding how much training reservists called up in the partial mobilization will receive.  </strong>Shoigu described a deliberate training process that would familiarize or re-familiarize mobilized reservists with crew, team, detachment, and then platoon-level operations before deploying them to fight. That process should take weeks, if not months, to bring reservists from civilian life to war readiness. Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security head Viktor Bondarev reportedly said that mobilized reservists would train for over a month before being deployed.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[7]</span> A military commissariat in Kursk Oblast, on the other hand, reportedly announced that reservists under 30 would deploy immediately with no additional training.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[8]</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Putin emphatically did <em>not </em>say that the Russian nuclear umbrella would cover annexed areas of Ukraine nor did he tie mobilization to the annexation. </strong>He addressed partial mobilization, annexation referenda in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, and the possibility of nuclear war in his speech—but as separate topics rather than a coherent whole.<strong> </strong>The fact that he mentioned all three topics in a single speech was clearly meant to suggest a linkage, but he went out of his way to avoid making any such linkage explicit.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Putin framed his comments about the possibility of Russian nuclear weapons use in the context of supposed Western threats to use nuclear weapons against Russia. He claimed that Western officials were talking about “the possibility and permissibility of using weapons of mass destruction—nuclear weapons—against Russia.” He continued, “I wish to remind those who allow themselves such statements about Russia that our country also has various means of attack...”  His comment on this topic concludes by noting that Russia would use all means at its disposal in response to a threat to “the territorial integrity of our country, for the defense of Russia and our people.” That comment could be interpreted as applying in advance to the soon-to-be annexed areas of occupied Ukraine, but its placement in the speech and context do not by any means make such an interpretation obvious. Nor is Putin’s language in making this comment different from formal Kremlin policy or from previous statements by Russian officials. <strong>Putin’s speech should not be read as an explicit threat that Russia would use nuclear weapons against Ukraine if Ukraine continues counter-offensives against occupied territories after annexation.</strong></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Putin did not connect annexation with the partial mobilization either, defending the need for partial mobilization by referring to the length of the lines along which Russian forces are now fighting and Western assistance to Ukraine. </strong>He noted that the front lines now stretch for more than a thousand kilometers to explain why more Russian forces are needed. He and Shoigu also heavily emphasized the false narrative that Russia is fighting not Ukraine but NATO and the West. This narrative is not new. It is not even markedly different from the initial false justifications Putin offered before ordering the invasion in February.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[9]</span> The formal Kremlin position has long been that NATO was pushing Ukraine to war with Russia, that NATO was preparing to give Ukraine nuclear weapons, and that NATO forces were taking up or preparing to take up positions in Ukraine. Putin’s and Shoigu’s repetitions of that line do not reflect an escalation in their rhetoric.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Russia’s partial mobilization will not transform the war this year and may or may not have a significant impact on Russia’s ability to continue operations at their current level next year.  </strong>Ukraine and the West should neither dismiss it nor exaggerate it. </p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>\\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><strong>Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announced “partial mobilization” will not materially affect the course of the war in the coming months.</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>Putin did <em>not </em>explicitly threaten to use nuclear weapons if Ukraine continues counter-offensive operations to liberate occupied areas after Russian annexation.</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>Ukrainian forces likely continued offensive operations around Lyman.</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>Ukrainian forces conducted strikes north and east of Kherson City as part of an operational-level interdiction campaign against Russian logistics, military, and transportation assets in Kherson Oblast.</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>Ukrainian and Russian sources identified three areas of kinetic activity on September 21: northwest of Kherson City, near the Ukrainian bridgehead over the Inhulets River, and south of the Kherson-Dnipropetrovsk Oblast border around Vysokopillya.</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>Russian federal subjects (regions) are continuing crypto-mobilization efforts regardless of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s declaration of partial mobilization.</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>Russian-appointed occupation administrators are likely increasing law enforcement and filtration measures in occupied areas of Ukraine in preparation for Russia’s sham annexation referenda.</strong></li>\\n</ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/DraftUkraineCOTSeptember21%2C2022.png\"><img src=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/DraftUkraineCOTSeptember21%2C2022.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"706\" /></a></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em>We do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting.

Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces attempted to break through Russian defenses around Yampil (just southeast of Lyman) and in Lyman itself.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[10]</span> Russian milbloggers also claimed that Russian and Ukrainian troops are actively fighting in Drobysheve (just northwest of Lyman). While ISW cannot independently verify these claims, they are consistent with previous visual evidence of Ukrainian counteroffensive operations along the Lyman-Yampil-Bilohorivka line. The Ukrainian General Staff also reported that Ukrainian troops repelled an attempted Russian attack near Kupyansk, eastern Kharkiv Oblast, along the Oskil River.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[11]</span> This report indicates that Russian troops are likely engaged in limited attempts to threaten newly recaptured Ukrainian positions along the right bank of the Oskil River.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kharkiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20September%2021%2C2022.png\"><img src=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kharkiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20September%2021%2C2022.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"870\" /></a></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Southern Ukraine: (Kherson Oblast)</strong></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Ukrainian military officials maintained operational silence regarding Ukrainian ground attacks in Kherson Oblast on September 21 and reiterated that Ukrainian forces are conducting an operational-level interdiction campaign in Kherson Oblast.

This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.</strong></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong> A large-scale explosion damaged the Kerch Strait Bridge that links occupied Crimea with Russia on October 8. </strong>Maxar satellite imagery shows that the explosion collapsed one lane of the road bridge and damaged the nearby railway track.[1] The Russian Investigative Committee stated that a truck exploded on the bridge and ignited seven fuel tanks on the railroad.[2] A small fraction of Russian milbloggers speculated that Ukrainian saboteurs used a boat to detonate the bridge from the sea, though there is no visible evidence for such a conclusion.[3] The Kremlin refrained from accusing Ukraine of sabotage or attack, echoing similar restraint following the sinking of the cruiser <em>Moskva </em>and the Ukrainian strike on Saky airfield in Crimea.[4] Ukraine did not claim responsibility for the incident, but <em>The New York Times</em> reported that an unnamed senior Ukrainian official stated that Ukrainian intelligence participated in the explosion.[5] Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov noted that the Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a government commission composed of government officials, security services, and the Ministry of Emergency Situations to investigate the ”emergency.”[6]</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">The explosion will not permanently disrupt critical Russian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) to Crimea, but its aftermath is likely to increase friction in Russian logistics for some time. </strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">The road bridge appears at least partially operational, and the railroad bridge did not suffer significant structural damage according to Russian reports that generally seem plausible based on the available video evidence.</span><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> </strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian footage shows people walking on the damaged road bridge and a train moving on the railroad bridge.[7] The Head of occupied Crimea Sergey Aksyonov claimed that the remaining lane of the road bridge opened to cars and buses after a rigorous security check, but that trucks must move by ferry.[8] The collapsed lane of the road bridge will restrict Russian military movements until it is repaired, forcing some Russian forces to rely on the ferry connection for some time. Russian forces will likely still be able to transport heavy military equipment via the railroad. Russian officials will likely intensify security checks on all vehicles crossing the bridge, however, adding delays to the movement of Russian military equipment, personnel, and supplies to Crimea. Putin has already signed a decree strengthening the security protocol on the bridge under the supervision of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB).[9]</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">The Kremlin is likely continuing to frame the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) as the scapegoat for the Kerch Bridge explosion and other Russian military failures to deflect the blame from Putin.</strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> The Russian MoD has not issued an official statement regarding the incident as of this publication.[10] Russian opposition outlet </span><em style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Meduza</em><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> reported that the Russian Presidential Administration sent out a guide to Russian mass media on the appropriate way to downplay the severity of the damage to the bridge, and it is possible that the Kremlin has ordered the Russian MoD to remain quiet regarding the situation.[11] Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov stated that Russia must initiate a strike campaign on critical Ukrainian infrastructure instead of listening to Russian MoD promises.[12]</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Some nationalist voices noted that Putin and his close circle are failing to immediately address the attack on the symbolic bridge, voicing direct criticism of Putin for the first time. </strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">A milblogger warned that if Putin fails to undertake retaliatory actions it “will be mistaken for the weakness of the president himself.”[13] Another milblogger noted that it is hypocritical for the Kremlin to call on Russians to rally behind Putin if he is unable to comment on significant events such as the </span><em style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Moskva</em><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> sinking, prisoner exchanges including Azovstal fighters, or the collapse of the Kharkiv frontline.[14] Others criticized the silence of Russian Deputy Chairman of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev regarding the explosion, given that Medvedev had made several statements defining any attacks on the Kerch Bridge as a violation of Russian ”red lines.”[15] Russian milbloggers and propagandists alike called on the Kremlin to resume strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure and notably did not make any calls for Russia to use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Ukrainian and Russian sources claimed that the Kremlin targeted some higher military command figures following the Kerch Bridge explosion, but these reports remain unverified as of this publication. </strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">The Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported that the Kremlin detained, arrested, and blocked unspecified military officials and ordered the units of the elite Dzerzhinsky Separate Operation Purpose Division to enter Moscow on October 8.[16] Milbloggers who favor the Wagner Group claimed that the Kremlin has replaced Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Army General Valery Gerasimov supposedly with Tula Governor Alexey Dyumin and the deputy commander-in-chief of the ground forces, Lieutenant General Alexander Matovnikov, respectively.[17] ISW cannot independently verify either of these reports at this time.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">The Kremlin named the Russian Commander of the Aerospace Forces, Army General Sergey Surovikin, the new commander of the Russian operation in Ukraine, and this appointment has generated positive feedback within the nationalist community. </strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Sorovikin previously commanded the “southern” group of forces in Ukraine and was reportedly responsible for the capture of Lysychansk in July.[18] Milbloggers shared their excitement regarding Surovikin’s appointment, noting that Surovikin has the “tough” character necessary to regain the initiative in Ukraine.[19] Wagner financier Yevgeniy Prigozhin extravagantly praised Surovikin because he “got into a tank and rushed to save” the Soviet Union during the 1991 coup attempt in Moscow.[20] Prigozhin’s interview further confirmed reports of a fissure between pro-war and “liberal” factions within the Kremlin, which ISW will consider in more detail in subsequent reports.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Key Takeaways</strong></p>\\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><strong>A large-scale explosion seriously

The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Russian forces repelled Ukrainian assaults southeast of Kupyansk.[21] The Head of the Kharkiv Oblast administration, Oleg Synehubov, reported that Russian forces continued to shell Kupyansk and surrounding settlements.[22] Russian forces continued routine artillery, air, and missile strikes in eastern Ukraine in the vicinity of Kharkiv City, Bohodukhiv, and near Izyum.[23]</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian sources also claimed that Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in the Kreminna direction on October 8. The Russian MoD claimed that Russian forces repelled Ukrainian forces attempting to cross the Zherebets River at an unspecified location.[24] The Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) People’s Militia claimed that Russian forces maintain full control over the Kreminna-Svatove highway, despite previous reports of Ukrainian forces operating in the area.[25] The Russian MoD also claimed that Russian airstrikes hit two Ukrainian concentrations of manpower south of Kreminna near Siversk and west of Kreminna near Yampilivka.[26] The Russian MoD is increasingly including tactical details about Ukrainian forces in its claims, likely in response to Russian milblogger criticism that they do not report enough on Ukrainian advances. ISW makes no attempt to evaluate the veracity of the details the Russian MoD presents about the sizes, echelons, designations, or types of Ukrainian units and will not present those details in our reports.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces are continuing to suffer personnel losses in Luhansk Oblast.

Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command reported that Russian forces continued to shell areas along the line of contact to prevent Ukrainian advances and began establishing new defensive lines in the Beryslav and Nova Kakhovka Raions.[28] A Russian source claimed that Ukrainian forces are continuing to consolidate along the front line near Davydiv Brid and Mala Oleksandrivka and are equipping strongholds in Bezimenne, all near the Ukrainian bridgehead over the Inhulets River.[29] ISW does not attempt to validate Russian forecasts of possible Ukrainian operations and offers no comment on their plausibility.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Ukrainian and Russian sources reported ongoing battles north and northwest of Kherson City, near the Ukrainian bridgehead over the Inhulets River, and northeast of Beryslav on October 8. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled a Russian ground attack near Ternovy Pody, roughly 20km northwest of Kherson City.[30] Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command reported that Russian forces unsuccessfully attempted to advance in the area of Davydiv Brid and Mala Oleksandrivka near the Ukrainian bridgehead over the Inhulets River.[31] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Russian forces repelled Ukrainian attempts to advance near Sukhanove, Pyatikhatki, Sadok, Ishchenka, Burskynske, Shchaslyve, and Mala Seidemynykha on the northern Kherson Oblast frontline.[32] A Russian source claimed that Russian forces retook Pravdyne, 33km northwest of Kherson City.[33] A Russian source claimed that Russian forces repelled a Ukrainian ground attack near Dudchany on the western bank of the Dnipro River.[34] The Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) claimed that Russian forces maintain positions in Snihurivka, Mykolaiv Oblast, approximately 60km east of Mykolaiv City, and reported ongoing fighting on the outskirts of the settlement.[35]</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Ukrainian forces continued their interdiction campaign in Kherson Oblast to support their southern counteroffensive on October 8. Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command reported that Ukrainian forces struck three Russian concentrations of manpower and equipment and a logistics point in Beryslav Raion.[36] Ukraine's Southern Operational Command also reported that Ukrainian aviation struck Russian anti-aircraft systems in Beryslav and Kakhovka Raions.[37] Geolocated images show that Ukrainian forces likely hit five fuel storage facilities near Kyselivka, Bilozerskyi Raion.[38] Ukrainian forces reportedly shot down a Russian Orlan-10 drone in Chervone, Beryslav Raion.[39] The Russian MoD claimed that land and maritime logistics routes are continuously provisioning Russian forces operating in the Mykolaiv-Kryvyi Rih and Zaporizhia directions, however.[40]</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kherson%20and%20Mykolaiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%208%2C%202022.png\"><img src=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kherson%20and%20Mykolaiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%208%2C%202022.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"688\" /></a></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Russian Main Effort—Eastern Ukraine</span></strong></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Russian Subordinate Main Effort—Donetsk Oblast</span></strong><strong> (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russia’s proxies in Donbas)</strong></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Russian forces continued conducting ground attacks throughout Donetsk Oblast on October 8. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian ground attacks on and around Bakhmut near Vyimka, Bilohorivka, Bakhmutske, and Krasna Hora to the north and Mayorsk, Ozeryanivka, Zaitseve, Odradivka, and Andriivka to the south.[41] A Russian milblogger referred to recent Russian-claimed gains south of Bakhmut of Zaitseve and Vesela Dolyna as a “tactical success.”[42] ISW first reported on Russian ground attacks against Zaitseve and Vesela Dolyna on August 5 and July 13 respectively, noting that Russian forces have taken over two months to be able to claim to have secured two small villages.[43] The Ukrainian General Staff also reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian ground assaults around Avdiivka near Pervomaiske, Vesele, Kamianka, and Nevelske, and in western Donetsk Oblast near Pobieda, Krasnohorivka, and Novomykhailivka.[44] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Russian forces repelled a Ukrainian counterattack at an unspecified location in the “South Donetsk” direction, possibly referring to the Vuhledar, western Donetsk Oblast area, but there is currently no independent confirmation of the Russian MoD’s definition of this operational direction.[45]</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Ukrainian forces likely conducted strikes against railway stations in the Russian rear in Donetsk Oblast on October 8. The DNR claimed that Ukrainian forces struck a railway station in Ilovaisk, Donetsk Oblast, damaging three diesel fuel tanks for trains and a technical area of the station.[46] Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces struck the Karan railway station in Andriivka, Donetsk Oblast, roughly 51km north of Mariupol.[47] Geolocated footage shows smoke rising from the station area with audible secondary detonations, likely from ammunition.[48]</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Donetsk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%208%2C%202022.png\"><img src=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Donetsk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%208%2C%202022.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"759\" /></a></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Supporting Effort—Southern Axis</span></strong><strong> (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)</strong></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian forces continued to conduct routine artillery, air, and missile strikes west of Hulyaipole and in Dnipropetrovsk and Mykolaiv Oblasts on October 8.[49] Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces attacked Zaporizhzhia City, Mykolaiv City, Ochakiv, and areas of Odesa Oblast with Shahed-136 kamikaze drones but stated that Ukrainian forces successfully shot them down.[50] Russian forces continued artillery fire and drone strikes against infrastructure in Nikopol and Marhanets, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, on the north bank of the Dnipro River.[51] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces shelled Russian manpower and equipment concentrations in the areas of Polohy and Tokmak, Zaporizhia Oblast, and that Russian forces suffered at least 85 casualties.[52]</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian and Ukrainian sources traded accusations of shelling the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) overnight on October 7-8.[53] Russian and Ukrainian officials and the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that the shelling cut off the external energy supply to the ZNPP after engineers had just restored the external power line on October 7.[54] Ukrainian Enerhodar Mayor Dmytro Orlov later stated that engineers restored power to Enerhodar and the surrounding settlements on October 8.[55] Russian Zaporizhia Oblast occupation official Vladimir Rogov stated that Russian atomic energy agency Rosatom has already started the process of integrating the ZNPP into the Russian power grid.[56]</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts</span></strong><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)</strong></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">The financial, logistical, and political challenges of supporting the Russian mobilization process continue to fuel societal division within Russia and criticism of the government. The Kremlin and Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD) risk alienating core supporters including those supportive of mobilization by failing to address inconsistencies and inadequacies in the implementation of mobilization.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">The large-scale removal of Russian men of working age (either through mobilization or through their flight) has left holes in the positions they formerly filled. A Russian source reported on October 6 that the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources proposed to exempt garbage collectors and garbage truck drivers from mobilization.[57] Forbes reported on October 6 that Russian sports centers again petitioned authorities for an exemption to mobilization for coaches and instructors, as mobilization applies to 70% of men employed in the industry.[58] Mothers caring for children after the mobilization of their husbands will also face greater non-work demands on their time. A Russian source reported on October 6 that the Liberal Democratic Party drafted a bill authorizing the reduction of work hours for mothers with mobilized husbands to 35 hours a week at prior salaries.[59] Russian authorities appear to have recognized and attempted to address labor shortages caused by mobilization. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on October 8 that local authorities in some Russian districts are attempting to implement mobilization plans drawing on unemployed men of conscription age.[60] However, the economic gaps left by the sudden removal of part of the Russian workforce are likely to continue to create complications.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Funding mobilization poses an economic challenge to Russian regions, as ISW has previously reported.[61] Russian regions balance pressure to deliver on promises to the mobilized while remaining within their means. A local Russian source reported on October 6 that Tartarstan Deputy Finance Minister Gela Gerasimova stated that the budget of Tartarstan cannot finance mobilization. Gerasimova claimed mobilization will draw on the federal budget.[62] Omsk Governor Aleksandr Burkov stated on October 7 that he found an unspecified way to pay each mobilized person 100,000 rubles ($1,603) after previously stating the region's budget could not afford such payments.[63] The costs of mobilization are likely to continue well into 2023, and the long-term viability of such solutions is questionable.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Poor behavior demonstrated by conscripts brought to training grounds has disturbed nearby communities. A Russian source reported on October 7 that residents of Mulino raised complaints that the mobilized sent to Mulino training grounds drank heavily and walked around the village. ISW has previously reported similar complaints in this area.[64] Nizhny Novgorod Governor Gleb Nikitin has therefore banned the sale of alcohol during mobilization in Mulino.[65]</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Reports from October 6 and 7 show a series of women across Russia recording video messages asking for help in response to their husbands’ illegal mobilization.[66] ISW has previously reported an ongoing pattern of mobilization of Russians with disqualifying health and personal circumstances.[67] </span><em style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Fontanka Saint Petersburg </em><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">reported on October 6 that a housewife in Krasnogvardeysky District, Saint Petersburg, received a mobilization notice.[68] This report is the first that ISW has identified detailing the mobilization of a woman without mention of a relevant work background.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Mobilized soldiers also continue to face extreme conditions. A Russian news source counted 15 deaths among the mobilized from various regions prior to deployment to Ukraine as of October 7.[69]</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Discrepancies in the level of public concern for newly mobilized units as compared to contract soldiers have likely created a rift in Russian society. Ukraine’s Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) published on October 8 a recording of a call between a contract Russian soldier and his mother. The mother complained that mobilized units face preferential treatment over volunteer and contract soldiers who have been fighting for months. The mother argued that Russian contract soldiers purchased their own equipment and faced the same difficulties as newly mobilized soldiers while the Russian public did not care in the same way that they do about the mobilized men. She also noted that contract soldiers faced such difficulties without the 200,000-300,000-ruble ($3,207-4,811)</span><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> </strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">bonus received by the mobilized.</span><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> </strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">The mother directly expressed discontent with the apparent unreachability of Putin on issues related to soldiers’ well-being and questioned whether he “even [knows] where our guys are?”[70] ISW cannot confirm the extent of such dissatisfaction, but the increasing concessions given to mobilized men in response to broad criticism of the mobilization effort could increase such feelings among contract soldiers, volunteer soldiers, and their families.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Deputy Russian Minister of Defense Viktor Goremykin deflected criticism that the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) is severely undersupplying soldiers by claiming on October 7 that the Russian Armed Forces “have everything necessary to provide for every servicemember in full.”[71] Widespread reports of Russian mobilized units being forced to purchase their own equipment and clothing, going for days with no food or water, and requesting donations from Russian society contradict Goremykin’s statement.[72] Russian military bloggers publicly mocked Goremykin’s false claim and marveled at the ability of the Russian MoD to continue denying obvious logistical problems. One Russian military blogger claimed that the Russian MoD prioritizes “attempts to create an external gloss” above the lives of soldiers and above the need to win.[73] Another military blogger stated that it is no longer possible to replace reality with beautiful reports.[74] Blatantly false claims decrease general belief in the credibility of the Russian MoD and contribute to the growing narrative of MoD incompetence.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian authorities appear to be avoiding prosecution of men avoiding military summonses. Russian lawyer Pavel Chikov posted to Telegram on October 7 that the Penza Prosecutor’s Office canceled the first criminal case for evasion of mobilization under Article 328 of the Russian criminal code after launching the case two days before.[75] Federation Council Committee on Constitutional Legislation and State Building Head Andrey Klishas stated on October 7 that it is unlawful to threaten citizens with criminal liability under Article 328 for refusal to mobilize.[76] Such responses could represent a response to public pressure or challenges in prosecuting all mobilization dodgers. They could also represent the desire to try mobilization dodgers under alternative articles or continue attempts to force dodgers to mobilize rather than sit in prison.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Activity in Russian-occupied Areas</span></strong><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of occupied and annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)</strong></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian and occupation administration officials continued to increase filtration and law enforcement measures in Russian-occupied territories on October 8. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on October 8 that Russian forces continue filtration activities near positions struck by Ukrainian forces to find suspected Ukrainian partisans that they believe to be providing Ukrainian forces with the positions of Russian manpower and equipment concentrations.[77] Russian media reported that Russian forces in Russian-occupied Melitopol have increased street inspections of residents’ documents.[78] The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported that Russian and occupation administration officials launched a Telegram chatbot for reports on the location of Ukrainian partisans in the Russian-occupied territories.[79] The center also reported that Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) personnel increasingly question residents in filtration centers about their participation in the annexation referenda that were held in Russian-occupied territories in late September.[80] Mayor of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov claimed that occupation administration officials are deporting residents with pro-Ukrainian sentiments and transporting them to the Vasylivka border checkpoint, but that  Russian forces are still not allowing residents to pass through into Ukrainian-held Zaporizhia Oblast.[81] Russian and occupation administration officials are likely to increase filtration and law enforcement activities as Ukrainian counteroffensives progress.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian and occupation administration officials continued measures to remove Ukrainian children from their homes in Russian-occupied territories on October 8. The Head of the Kherson Occupation Administration Vladimir Saldo reported that Russian-occupied Crimea agreed to take over 5,000 children from Kherson Oblast “on vacation” and that 1,500 of those children have already arrived in Crimea.[82] Vladimir Saldo also announced that the governors of Krasnodar Krai and Stavropol Krai stated that their administrations are ready to accept up to 10,000 children from Kherson Oblast. Saldo did not specify a duration for such offers or “vacations.”[83] Vladimir Saldo stated that the children’s parents would be able to join their children in the territories to which they are sent.[84]</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Note: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

Kagan, Kateryna Stepanenko, and Karolina Hird</strong></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\"><strong>April 23, 6:30 pm ET</strong></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian forces continued offensive operations along multiple axes even as they completed moving reinforcements drawn from the retreat from Kyiv into the east and continued redeploying some forces from Mariupol to the north. </strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">The Russians have not taken time to refit troops moving from Kyiv or Mariupol before recommitting them to combat operations. They are not pausing offensive operations to wait until they have concentrated overwhelming combat power, and they do not appear to be massing forces on a few decisive axes of advance. They are continuing the pattern of operations they have followed throughout the war: committing small collections of units to widely dispersed attacks along multiple axes and refusing to accept necessary operational pauses to set conditions for decisive operations.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian forces have thus far only committed a handful of battalion tactical groups (BTGs) to offensive operations in their various sectors, however, and could still launch a massed offensive operation. </strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">We assess that such an operation is unlikely given observed patterns and the inherent limitations of available actual combat power in troops that have fought hard and suffered many casualties, as well as observed challenges with command-and-control at the regiment/brigade and division level. It is possible that the Russians are addressing or attempting to address some of those challenges and will soon launch an offensive in a new and better-coordinated form, but it remains unlikely.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">The objectives of Russian offensives around the Izyum-Donetsk City salient are unclear. </strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian forces may seek to reach the Izyum-Debaltseve road along two or more axes to encircle a large concentration of Ukrainian forces and built-up areas. Ukrainian officials suggested on April 23 that Russian forces near Rubizhne and Popasna may seek to encircle the Severodonetsk-Lysychansk area rather than pursue the deeper envelopment.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[1]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> It is too soon to evaluate the likelihood of this Russian course of action or the probability of its success.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>\\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian forces continued their pressure on the Azovstal facility in Mariupol.</strong></li>\\n</ul><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian troops drawn from the retreat from Kyiv are re-entering combat in eastern Ukraine.</strong></li>\\n<li><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian forces from around Mariupol are redeploying to the vicinity of Donetsk City and are likely to enter combat again soon and without rest or refit.</strong></li>\\n</ul><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russia continued conducting small-scale ground offensives at multiple points along the front from Izyum to Zaporizhia Oblast.</strong></li>\\n</ul><div><a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/DraftUkraineCoTApril23%2C2022.png\"><strong><img src=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/DraftUkraineCoTApril23%2C2022.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"706\" /></strong></a></div>\\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"><em>We do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting.

This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong> Russian President Vladimir Putin celebrated the Russian seizure of Lysychansk and the Luhansk Oblast border and appeared to direct the Russian military to conduct an operational pause. </strong>Putin met with Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu on July 4 to discuss recent Russian gains in Luhansk Oblast and presented Colonel General Alexander Lapin and Major General Esedulla Abachev with the “Hero of Russia” award for their leadership during the Lysychansk operation.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[1]</span> Putin and Shoigu presented the capture of Lysychansk and Luhansk Oblast as a major victory for Russian forces in Ukraine. Putin also stated that the Russian units that participated in the battle for Lysychansk should rest to increase their combat capabilities.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[2]</span> Putin‘s public comment was likely meant to signal his concern for the welfare of his troops in the face of periodic complaints in Russia about the treatment of Russian soldiers. His comment was also likely accurate—Russian troops that fought through Severodonetsk and Lysychansk very likely do need a significant period in which to rest and refit before resuming large-scale offensive operations. It is not clear, however, that the Russian military will accept the risks of a long enough operational pause to allow these likely exhausted forces to regain their strength.</p>\\n<p><strong>Former Russian military commander Igor Girkin, an ardent Russian nationalist who commanded militants during the 2014 war in Donbas, posted a scathing critique of the Kremlin’s handling of the war on his Telegram channel and questioned the significance of the seizure of Lysychansk. He suggested that Russian forces had paid too high a price for a limited gain. </strong>In a series of Telegram posts published prior to Putin’s meeting with Shoigu on July 4, Girkin complained that Russian forces have failed to meet the announced goals of the “second stage of the special operation” (the operations in eastern Ukraine following Russia’s retreat from Kyiv) to his nearly 400,000 subscribers.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[3]</span> Girkin noted that the Ukrainian defense of Lysychansk was deliberately designed to inflict maximum damage on Russian troops and burn through Russian manpower and equipment. He strongly suggested that accepting battle on the Ukrainians‘ terms was a significant misstep by the Russian leadership.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[4]</span> Girkin stated (before Putin’s remarks were made public) that Russian troops need time to rest and replenish in order to recover their offensive potential and noted that the lack of individual soldier replacements and unit rotations is severely degrading morale. He warned, however, that taking time to reconstitute offensive capability would allow Ukrainian troops to seize the initiative and further threaten Russian gains.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[5]</span> Girkin additionally claimed that Russian forces have limited prospects of advancing elsewhere in Ukraine due to Ukrainian personnel and equipment superiority.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[6]</span></p>\\n<p>Girkin’s critique is a noteworthy example of the way Russian milbloggers and military enthusiasts have become disillusioned with the Kremlin’s handling and execution of operations in Ukraine, particularly after the dramatic failed river crossing attempt at Bilohorivka in early May.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[7]</span> Girkin’s statements directly undermine the Kremlin’s efforts to frame Lysychansk as a significant victory or turning point and show that the disillusionment amongst ultra-nationalist elements in the Russian information space continues to run deep. Girkin’s assessment of Russian military failures notably aligns with much of ISW’s (and other Western agencies’ and experts’) analysis, suggesting that he and some other milbloggers continue to make and publish assessments of the situation and forecasts independent of the Kremlin line. Girkin likely hopes to use his status as a prominent former participant in the war in Donbas in 2014 to persuade Putin to take certain measures to secure Russian success in a war that Girkin still thinks is justified and necessary—specifically mobilizing the Russian population for war on a much larger scale.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[8]</span> Girkin, along with other members of the Russian nationalist milblogger space, will likely continue to offer critiques of the Kremlin’s line on operations in Ukraine to advocate for general mobilization and more competent Russian military leadership.</p>\\n<p><strong>Ukrainian forces are increasingly targeting Russian military infrastructure with indirect fire and US-provided HIMARS systems deep in occupied territory. </strong>Ukrainian forces reportedly struck Russian ammunition depots in Dibrivne, Kharkiv Oblast, (close to the frontline) on July 4 and Snizhne, Donetsk Oblast, (approximately 75 km from the frontlines) overnight on July 3-4 following a strike on one of four Russian ammunition depots in Melitopol on July 3.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[9]</span> The Ukrainian General Staff also published a video on July 4 of a Ukrainian HIMARS (high mobility artillery rocket system) operating in an unspecified area of Zaporizhia Oblast.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[10]</span> The increased ability of Ukrainian forces to target critical Russian military facilities with Western-provided HIMARS demonstrates how Western military aid provides Ukraine with new and necessary military capabilities.</p>\\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>\\n<ul><li><strong>Russian leadership may be setting conditions for an operational pause following the seizure of Lysychansk and the Luhansk Oblast boundary.</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>Russian forces are consolidating territorial and administrative control over Severodonetsk and Lysychansk.</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>Russian forces continued offensive operations to the east of Bakhmut to prepare for advances on Bakhmut and Siversk.</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>Russian forces continued limited and unsuccessful assaults north of Kharkiv City.</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>Ukrainian partisan activity is targeting Russian railway lines around Melitopol and Tokmak.</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>Russian leadership may be setting conditions for the conscription of Ukrainian citizens living in occupied territories.</strong></li>\\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/DraftUkraineCoTJuly4%2C2022.png\"><img src=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/DraftUkraineCoTJuly4%2C2022.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"706\" /></a></p>\\n<p><strong><em>We do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting.

[1] putin’s order to mobilize part of russia’s “trained” reserve, that is, individuals who have completed their mandatory conscript service, will not generate significant usable russian combat power for months. it may suffice to sustain the current levels of russian military manpower in 2023 by offsetting russian casualties, although even that is not yet clear. it will occur in deliberate phases, russian defense minister sergei shoigu said in an interview on september 21, likely precluding any sudden influx of russian forces that could dramatically shift the tide of the war. [2] russia’s partial mobilization will thus not deprive ukraine of the opportunity to liberate more of its occupied territory into and through the winter. putin and shoigu emphatically said that only reservists who have completed their initial military service will be mobilized, making clear that russia will not be expanding conscription. shoigu also declared that students will not be affected and told them to go about their studies without concern. [3] these comments were clearly intended to allay fears among the russian population that “partial mobilization” was code for general conscription. it is not clear how much of the russian reserve has already been deployed to fight in ukraine. western intelligence officials reportedly said in november 2021 that russia had called up “tens of thousands of reservists” as part of its pre-war mobilization. [4] ukrainian military officials reported in june 2022 that russian forces had committed 80,000 members of the mobilized reserve to fight in ukraine. [5] the russian military likely called up the most combat-ready reserves in that pre-war mobilization effort, which suggests that the current partial mobilization will begin by drawing on less combat-ready personnel from the outset. russian reserves are poorly trained to begin with and receive no refresher training once their conscription period is completed. russian mandatory military service is only one year, which gives conscripts little time to learn how to be soldiers, to begin with. the absence of refresher training after that initial period accelerates the degradation of learned soldier skills over time. shoigu referred to the intent of calling up reservists with “combat experience,” but very few russian reservists other than those now serving in ukraine have any combat experience. [6] reports conflict regarding how much training reservists called up in the partial mobilization will receive. shoigu described a deliberate training process that would familiarize or re-familiarize mobilized reservists with crew, team, detachment, and then platoon-level operations before deploying them to fight. that process should take weeks, if not months, to bring reservists from civilian life to war readiness. federation council committee on defense and security head viktor bondarev reportedly said that mobilized reservists would train for over a month before being deployed. [7] a military commissariat in kursk oblast, on the other hand, reportedly announced that reservists under 30 would deploy immediately with no additional training. [8] putin emphatically did not say that the russian nuclear umbrella would cover annexed areas of ukraine nor did he tie mobilization to the annexation. he addressed partial mobilization, annexation referenda in russian-occupied areas of ukraine, and the possibility of nuclear war in his speech—but as separate topics rather than a coherent whole. the fact that he mentioned all three topics in a single speech was clearly meant to suggest a linkage, but he went out of his way to avoid making any such linkage explicit. putin framed his comments about the possibility of russian nuclear weapons use in the context of supposed western threats to use nuclear weapons against russia. he claimed that western officials were talking about “the possibility and permissibility of using weapons of mass destruction—nuclear weapons—against russia.” he continued, “i wish to remind those who allow themselves such statements about russia that our country also has various means of attack...”  his comment on this topic concludes by noting that russia would use all means at its disposal in response to a threat to “the territorial integrity of our country, for the defense of russia and our people.” that comment could be interpreted as applying in advance to the soon-to-be annexed areas of occupied ukraine, but its placement in the speech and context do not by any means make such an interpretation obvious. nor is putin’s language in making this comment different from formal kremlin policy or from previous statements by russian officials. putin’s speech should not be read as an explicit threat that russia would use nuclear weapons against ukraine if ukraine continues counter-offensives against occupied territories after annexation. putin did not connect annexation with the partial mobilization either, defending the need for partial mobilization by referring to the length of the lines along which russian forces are now fighting and western assistance to ukraine. he noted that the front lines now stretch for more than a thousand kilometers to explain why more russian forces are needed. he and shoigu also heavily emphasized the false narrative that russia is fighting not ukraine but nato and the west. this narrative is not new. it is not even markedly different from the initial false justifications putin offered before ordering the invasion in february. [9] the formal kremlin position has long been that nato was pushing ukraine to war with russia, that nato was preparing to give ukraine nuclear weapons, and that nato forces were taking up or preparing to take up positions in ukraine. putin’s and shoigu’s repetitions of that line do not reflect an escalation in their rhetoric. russia’s partial mobilization will not transform the war this year and may or may not have a significant impact on russia’s ability to continue operations at their current level next year. ukraine and the west should neither dismiss it nor exaggerate it. key takeaways russian president vladimir putin’s announced “partial mobilization” will not materially affect the course of the war in the coming months. putin did not explicitly threaten to use nuclear weapons if ukraine continues counter-offensive operations to liberate occupied areas after russian annexation. ukrainian forces likely continued offensive operations around lyman. ukrainian forces conducted strikes north and east of kherson city as part of an operational-level interdiction campaign against russian logistics, military, and transportation assets in kherson oblast. ukrainian and russian sources identified three areas of kinetic activity on september 21: northwest of kherson city, near the ukrainian bridgehead over the inhulets river, and south of the kherson-dnipropetrovsk oblast border around vysokopillya. russian federal subjects (regions) are continuing crypto-mobilization efforts regardless of russian president vladimir putin’s declaration of partial mobilization. russian-appointed occupation administrators are likely increasing law enforcement and filtration measures in occupied areas of ukraine in preparation for russia’s sham annexation referenda. we do not report in detail on russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. we will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in ukrainian urban areas. we utterly condemn these russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, geneva conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports. ukrainian counteroffensives—southern and eastern ukraine russian main effort—eastern ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and two supporting efforts); russian subordinate main effort—capture the entirety of donetsk oblast russian supporting effort—southern axis russian mobilization and force generation efforts activities in russian-occupied areas ukrainian counteroffensives (ukrainian efforts to liberate russian-occupied territories) eastern ukraine: (vovchansk-kupyansk-izyum-lyman line) ukrainian forces likely continued counteroffensive operations toward lyman on september 21. russian milbloggers claimed that ukrainian forces attempted to break through russian defenses around yampil (just southeast of lyman) and in lyman itself. [10] russian milbloggers also claimed that russian and ukrainian troops are actively fighting in drobysheve (just northwest of lyman). while isw cannot independently verify these claims, they are consistent with previous visual evidence of ukrainian counteroffensive operations along the lyman-yampil-bilohorivka line. the ukrainian general staff also reported that ukrainian troops repelled an attempted russian attack near kupyansk, eastern kharkiv oblast, along the oskil river. [11] this report indicates that russian troops are likely engaged in limited attempts to threaten newly recaptured ukrainian positions along the right bank of the oskil river. southern ukraine: (kherson oblast) ukrainian military officials maintained operational silence regarding ukrainian ground attacks in kherson oblast on september 21 and reiterated that ukrainian forces are conducting an operational-level interdiction campaign in kherson oblast. ukraine’s southern operational command and the ukrainian general staff both noted that ukrainian strikes targeted russian equipment, logistics, transportation, and command and control assets in southern ukraine throughout the day. [12] social media footage provided visual evidence of the continuing ukrainian interdiction campaign against russian positions north and east of kherson city on september 20 and 21. geolocated footage showed the aftermath of ukrainian strikes on kherson city that reportedly hit a factory, a semiconductor plant, a russian base, and a ferry crossing near the antonivsky bridge. [13] ukraine’s southern operation command noted that ukrainian troops hit russian equipment and manpower concentrations and a command post of the 7th guards air assault division just north of kherson city in chornobaivka. [14] social media footage from september 20 also showed that ukrainian forces struck russian positions in nova kakhovka, about 60km east of kherson city, corroborating ukrainian claims of ukrainian strikes on russian positions in nova kakhovka. [15] ukraine’s southern operational command additionally stated that ukrainian troops hit russian command posts in beryslav raion (65km east of kherson city). [16] ukrainian and russian sources identified three areas of kinetic activity on september 21: northwest of kherson city, near the ukrainian bridgehead over the inhulets river, and south of the kherson-dnipropetrovsk oblast border around vysokopillya. the russian defense ministry and russian milbloggers claimed that russian forces are continuing to strike ukrainian military equipment in pravdyne (around 30km northwest of kherson city). [17] the ukrainian general staff also noted that russian forces shelled pravdyne. [18] geolocated footage showed ukrainian forces striking russian military equipment in davydiv brid. [19] ukraine’s southern operational command noted that ukrainian forces destroyed russian drones when they were conducting aerial reconnaissance over kostyrka (southeast of vysokopillya) and novodmytrivka on the eastern bank of the inhulets river along the t2207 highway. [20] an uptick in russian aerial reconnaissance in these areas may indicate that russian forces have shifted forces away from this sector of the front. russian main effort—eastern ukraine russian subordinate main effort—donetsk oblast (russian objective: capture the entirety of donetsk oblast, the claimed territory of russia’s proxies in donbas) russian forces continued ground attacks on the eastern outskirts of bakhmut and against avdiivka and continued routine fire along the frontline in donetsk oblast on september 21. [21] the ukrainian general staff reported that ukrainian forces repelled russian attacks against vesele, just northeast of soledar; zaitseve and kurdyumivka, south of bakhmut; and bakhmutske, northeast of bakhmut. [22] geolocated footage confirmed ukrainian forces maintain positions on the eastern outskirts of bakhmut, reportedly on the grounds of the champagne wine factory. [23] the ukrainian general staff reported that russian forces shelled but did not inflict any damage against the slovyansk thermal power plant, likely as part of russia’s continuing campaign to degrade ukrainian critical infrastructure. [24] russian forces conducted airstrikes against infrastructure facilities in bakhmut, indicating that ukrainian forces still hold fortified positions in the city. [25] russian forces conducted routine shelling in western donetsk oblast and eastern zaporizhia oblast, and additional russian forces deployed to the zaporizhia oblast frontline. ukraine’s general staff reported continued shelling along the frontline in the area. [26] the russian ministry of defense (mod) claimed that ukrainian forces conducted a failed ground attack near pavlivka, just north of vuhledar. [27] a russian source claimed that russian forces are conducting artillery strikes on an unspecified road towards vodyane, likely either the t0524 or t0509 highway or the slavne-vodyane road. [28] the russian source also claimed that ukrainian forces are deploying large quantities of equipment in the vuhledar direction, though isw cannot independently confirm this report. [29] a ukrainian source stated that elements of the russian 42nd motorized rifle division are deployed on the zaporizhia oblast frontline and that several armored personnel carriers of the 35th and 74th motorized rifle brigades traveled through rozivka, zaporizhia oblast, likely to positions along the front line. [30] supporting effort—southern axis (russian objective: maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against ukrainian strikes) russian forces did not conduct any ground assaults in western zaporizhia oblast and continued routine fire against ukrainian frontline positions and rear areas in mykolaiv oblast on september 21. [31] official ukrainian sources reported that russian forces struck unspecified infrastructure facilities in zaporizhzhia city, zaporizhia oblast; synelnykove raion, dnipropetrovsk oblast; and shevchenkove and ochakiv, mykolaiv oblast. [32] the ukrainian general staff reported on september 21 that ukrainian strikes inflicted severe casualties on russian forces in zaporizhia oblast on september 19, including killing 50 personnel and destroying 15 units of military equipment and an ammunition depot in the melitopol and polohy administrative districts as well as in the area of kamianka. [33] russian and ukrainian sources traded accusations of striking the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (znpp) on september 21, damaging one of the power units. ukrainian state nuclear agency energoatom stated that russian shelling damaged the communication equipment and a transformer for reactor number 6. [34] energoatom reported that the damaged transformer cut power to the reactor, forcing two emergency diesel generators to kick in to provide power to the reactor’s cooling pumps. znpp employees reportedly enabled an alternate power supply and shut down the emergency generators within an hour of the attack. the russian ministry of defense claimed that a ukrainian large-caliber projectile damaged a water pipe of reactor number 5’s safety system and shelling damaged a power line to reactor number 6. [35] an image circulated by social media users on september 21 shows a burst water pipe at the znpp near the reactor buildings. [36] russian forces continued routine fire against ukrainian positions on the opposite side of the kakhovka reservoir from enerhodar. [37] russian and ukrainian sources reported explosions in the black sea near sevastopol, crimea on september 21. [38] the russian-appointed occupation governor of sevastopol, mikhail razvozhayev stated that russian authorities discovered an unmanned water surface vehicle on soldatskyi beach and detonated the vehicle, causing the explosion. [39] mobilization and force generation efforts (russian objective: expand combat power without conducting general mobilization) russian federal subjects (regions) are continuing crypto-mobilization efforts regardless of russian president vladimir putin’s declaration of partial mobilization on september 21. novosibirsk oblast governor andrey travnikov announced that the oblast will form one or two more volunteer battalions if necessary for the russian special military operation in ukraine. [40] the ukrainian general staff added that the ”self-mobilization” campaign is ongoing simultaneously with partial mobilization, noting that cossacks are recruiting candidates to serve in rosgvardia. [41] the ukrainian general staff added that the kuban cossack army is forming additional volunteer units and training them at the cossack bases in krasnodar krai. the ukrainian general staff also noted that russian forces are misleading men into entering military service by offering them “construction” jobs in ukraine. russian federal subjects will likely continue advertising volunteer service and promising large bonus payments to incentivize more men to volunteer for contract service rather than waiting to be mobilized. russian forces are also continuing to replenish personnel with prisoner recruits and forcibly mobilized men from proxy areas. the ukrainian general staff reported that russian forces are still detaining men of conscription age in occupied luhansk and donetsk oblast. [42] the ukrainian main military intelligence directorate (gur) stated that russian forces established a training camp in occupied torez (about 62km due east of donetsk city) for russian prisoners. [43] the gur added that russian forces also began to recruit prisoners serving time in the donetsk people’s republic (dnr) into the dnr 100th separate motorized rifle brigade and “somali” battalion as well as the russian 9th separate motorized rifle regiment. the gur noted that recruiters select prisoners based on their physical characteristics and previous military experience, regardless of the severity of their crimes. the dnr leadership also reportedly revoked previously issued exemptions from mobilization and is continuing to mobilize industrial workers for combat service. activity in russian-occupied areas (russian objective: consolidate administrative control of occupied areas; set conditions for potential annexation into the russian federation or some other future political arrangement of moscow’s choosing) russian-appointed occupation administrators are likely increasing law enforcement and filtration measures in occupied areas of ukraine to maintain control of ukrainian populations and preempt partisan attacks ahead of russia’s sham annexation referenda, currently scheduled for september 23-27. [44] the ukrainian head of kherson oblast, yaroslav yanushevich, stated on september 21 that russian forces are escalating filtration measures and inspections of private property throughout occupied kherson oblast. [45] russian-backed authorities have also increased restrictions on movement out of occupied territories, likely to prevent large portions of the population in occupied territory from fleeing to ukrainian-held territory ahead of russia’s illegal annexation of occupied ukrainian territory and russian “partial mobilization.” ukrainian mariupol mayoral advisor petro andryushchenko claimed that the russian-backed commandant’s office in mariupol will stop issuing passes to civilians who wish to leave occupied parts of donetsk oblast on october 1. [46] andryushchenko also noted that russian forces at the checkpoint in vasylivka, zaporizhia oblast, are introducing special passes and increased restrictions for those who want to leave occupied zaporizhia oblast.

This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement of “partial mobilization” on September 21 reflected many problems Russia faces in its faltering invasion of Ukraine that Moscow is unlikely to be able to resolve in the coming months.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[1]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Putin’s order to mobilize part of Russia’s “trained” reserve, that is, individuals who have completed their mandatory conscript service, will not generate significant usable Russian combat power for months. It may suffice to sustain the current levels of Russian military manpower in 2023 by offsetting Russian casualties, although even that is not yet clear. It will occur in deliberate phases, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said in an interview on September 21, likely precluding any sudden influx of Russian forces that could dramatically shift the tide of the war.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt; Russia’s partial mobilization will thus not deprive Ukraine of the opportunity to liberate more of its occupied territory into and through the winter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putin and Shoigu emphatically said that only reservists who have completed their initial military service will be mobilized, making clear that Russia will not be expanding conscription. &lt;/strong&gt;Shoigu also declared that students will not be affected and told them to go about their studies without concern.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;  These comments were clearly intended to allay fears among the Russian population that “partial mobilization” was code for general conscription.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not clear how much of the Russian reserve has already been deployed to fight in Ukraine. &lt;/strong&gt;Western intelligence officials reportedly said in November 2021 that Russia had called up “tens of thousands of reservists” as part of its pre-war mobilization.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt; Ukrainian military officials reported in June 2022 that Russian forces had committed 80,000 members of the mobilized reserve to fight in Ukraine.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt; The Russian military likely called up the most combat-ready reserves in that pre-war mobilization effort, which suggests that the current partial mobilization will begin by drawing on less combat-ready personnel from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian reserves are poorly trained to begin with and receive no refresher training once their conscription period is completed. &lt;/strong&gt;Russian mandatory military service is only one year, which gives conscripts little time to learn how to be soldiers, to begin with. The absence of refresher training after that initial period accelerates the degradation of learned soldier skills over time. Shoigu referred to the intent of calling up reservists with “combat experience,” but very few Russian reservists other than those now serving in Ukraine have any combat experience.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reports conflict regarding how much training reservists called up in the partial mobilization will receive.  &lt;/strong&gt;Shoigu described a deliberate training process that would familiarize or re-familiarize mobilized reservists with crew, team, detachment, and then platoon-level operations before deploying them to fight. That process should take weeks, if not months, to bring reservists from civilian life to war readiness. Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security head Viktor Bondarev reportedly said that mobilized reservists would train for over a month before being deployed.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[7]&lt;/span&gt; A military commissariat in Kursk Oblast, on the other hand, reportedly announced that reservists under 30 would deploy immediately with no additional training.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[8]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putin emphatically did &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;say that the Russian nuclear umbrella would cover annexed areas of Ukraine nor did he tie mobilization to the annexation. &lt;/strong&gt;He addressed partial mobilization, annexation referenda in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, and the possibility of nuclear war in his speech—but as separate topics rather than a coherent whole.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The fact that he mentioned all three topics in a single speech was clearly meant to suggest a linkage, but he went out of his way to avoid making any such linkage explicit.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;Putin framed his comments about the possibility of Russian nuclear weapons use in the context of supposed Western threats to use nuclear weapons against Russia. He claimed that Western officials were talking about “the possibility and permissibility of using weapons of mass destruction—nuclear weapons—against Russia.” He continued, “I wish to remind those who allow themselves such statements about Russia that our country also has various means of attack...”  His comment on this topic concludes by noting that Russia would use all means at its disposal in response to a threat to “the territorial integrity of our country, for the defense of Russia and our people.” That comment could be interpreted as applying in advance to the soon-to-be annexed areas of occupied Ukraine, but its placement in the speech and context do not by any means make such an interpretation obvious. Nor is Putin’s language in making this comment different from formal Kremlin policy or from previous statements by Russian officials. &lt;strong&gt;Putin’s speech should not be read as an explicit threat that Russia would use nuclear weapons against Ukraine if Ukraine continues counter-offensives against occupied territories after annexation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putin did not connect annexation with the partial mobilization either, defending the need for partial mobilization by referring to the length of the lines along which Russian forces are now fighting and Western assistance to Ukraine. &lt;/strong&gt;He noted that the front lines now stretch for more than a thousand kilometers to explain why more Russian forces are needed. He and Shoigu also heavily emphasized the false narrative that Russia is fighting not Ukraine but NATO and the West. This narrative is not new. It is not even markedly different from the initial false justifications Putin offered before ordering the invasion in February.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[9]&lt;/span&gt; The formal Kremlin position has long been that NATO was pushing Ukraine to war with Russia, that NATO was preparing to give Ukraine nuclear weapons, and that NATO forces were taking up or preparing to take up positions in Ukraine. Putin’s and Shoigu’s repetitions of that line do not reflect an escalation in their rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia’s partial mobilization will not transform the war this year and may or may not have a significant impact on Russia’s ability to continue operations at their current level next year.  &lt;/strong&gt;Ukraine and the West should neither dismiss it nor exaggerate it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announced “partial mobilization” will not materially affect the course of the war in the coming months.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putin did &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;explicitly threaten to use nuclear weapons if Ukraine continues counter-offensive operations to liberate occupied areas after Russian annexation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian forces likely continued offensive operations around Lyman.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian forces conducted strikes north and east of Kherson City as part of an operational-level interdiction campaign against Russian logistics, military, and transportation assets in Kherson Oblast.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian and Russian sources identified three areas of kinetic activity on September 21: northwest of Kherson City, near the Ukrainian bridgehead over the Inhulets River, and south of the Kherson-Dnipropetrovsk Oblast border around Vysokopillya.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian federal subjects (regions) are continuing crypto-mobilization efforts regardless of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s declaration of partial mobilization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian-appointed occupation administrators are likely increasing law enforcement and filtration measures in occupied areas of Ukraine in preparation for Russia’s sham annexation referenda.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/DraftUkraineCOTSeptember21%2C2022.png\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/DraftUkraineCOTSeptember21%2C2022.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"706\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ukrainian Counteroffensives—Southern and Eastern Ukraine&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Russian Main Effort—Eastern Ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and two supporting efforts);&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Russian Subordinate Main Effort—Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Russian Supporting Effort—Southern Axis&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Russian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Activities in Russian-occupied Areas&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian Counteroffensives (Ukrainian efforts to liberate Russian-occupied territories)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eastern Ukraine: (Vovchansk-Kupyansk-Izyum-Lyman Line)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;Ukrainian forces likely continued counteroffensive operations toward Lyman on September 21. Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces attempted to break through Russian defenses around Yampil (just southeast of Lyman) and in Lyman itself.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[10]&lt;/span&gt; Russian milbloggers also claimed that Russian and Ukrainian troops are actively fighting in Drobysheve (just northwest of Lyman). While ISW cannot independently verify these claims, they are consistent with previous visual evidence of Ukrainian counteroffensive operations along the Lyman-Yampil-Bilohorivka line. The Ukrainian General Staff also reported that Ukrainian troops repelled an attempted Russian attack near Kupyansk, eastern Kharkiv Oblast, along the Oskil River.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[11]&lt;/span&gt; This report indicates that Russian troops are likely engaged in limited attempts to threaten newly recaptured Ukrainian positions along the right bank of the Oskil River.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kharkiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20September%2021%2C2022.png\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kharkiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20September%2021%2C2022.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"870\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Southern Ukraine: (Kherson Oblast)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;Ukrainian military officials maintained operational silence regarding Ukrainian ground attacks in Kherson Oblast on September 21 and reiterated that Ukrainian forces are conducting an operational-level interdiction campaign in Kherson Oblast. Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command and the Ukrainian General Staff both noted that Ukrainian strikes targeted Russian equipment, logistics, transportation, and command and control assets in southern Ukraine throughout the day.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[12]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;Social media footage provided visual evidence of the continuing Ukrainian interdiction campaign against Russian positions north and east of Kherson City on September 20 and 21. Geolocated footage showed the aftermath of Ukrainian strikes on Kherson City that reportedly hit a factory, a semiconductor plant, a Russian base, and a ferry crossing near the Antonivsky Bridge.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[13]&lt;/span&gt; Ukraine’s Southern Operation Command noted that Ukrainian troops hit Russian equipment and manpower concentrations and a command post of the 7th Guards Air Assault Division just north of Kherson City in Chornobaivka.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[14]&lt;/span&gt; Social media footage from September 20 also showed that Ukrainian forces struck Russian positions in Nova Kakhovka, about 60km east of Kherson City, corroborating Ukrainian claims of Ukrainian strikes on Russian positions in Nova Kakhovka.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[15]&lt;/span&gt; Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command additionally stated that Ukrainian troops hit Russian command posts in Beryslav Raion (65km east of Kherson City).&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[16]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;Ukrainian and Russian sources identified three areas of kinetic activity on September 21: northwest of Kherson City, near the Ukrainian bridgehead over the Inhulets River, and south of the Kherson-Dnipropetrovsk Oblast border around Vysokopillya. The Russian Defense Ministry and Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces are continuing to strike Ukrainian military equipment in Pravdyne (around 30km northwest of Kherson City).&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[17]&lt;/span&gt; The Ukrainian General Staff also noted that Russian forces shelled Pravdyne.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[18]&lt;/span&gt; Geolocated footage showed Ukrainian forces striking Russian military equipment in Davydiv Brid.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[19]&lt;/span&gt; Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command noted that Ukrainian forces destroyed Russian drones when they were conducting aerial reconnaissance over Kostyrka (southeast of Vysokopillya) and Novodmytrivka on the eastern bank of the Inhulets River along the T2207 highway.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[20]&lt;/span&gt; An uptick in Russian aerial reconnaissance in these areas may indicate that Russian forces have shifted forces away from this sector of the front.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kherson-Mykolaiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20September%2021%2C2022.png\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kherson-Mykolaiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20September%2021%2C2022.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"784\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian Main Effort—Eastern Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian Subordinate Main Effort—Donetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russia’s proxies in Donbas)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;Russian forces continued ground attacks on the eastern outskirts of Bakhmut and against Avdiivka and continued routine fire along the frontline in Donetsk Oblast on September 21.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[21]&lt;/span&gt; The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian attacks against Vesele, just northeast of Soledar; Zaitseve and Kurdyumivka, south of Bakhmut; and Bakhmutske, northeast of Bakhmut.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[22]&lt;/span&gt; Geolocated footage confirmed Ukrainian forces maintain positions on the eastern outskirts of Bakhmut, reportedly on the grounds of the Champagne Wine Factory.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[23]&lt;/span&gt; The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces shelled but did not inflict any damage against the Slovyansk Thermal Power Plant, likely as part of Russia’s continuing campaign to degrade Ukrainian critical infrastructure.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[24]&lt;/span&gt; Russian forces conducted airstrikes against infrastructure facilities in Bakhmut, indicating that Ukrainian forces still hold fortified positions in the city.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[25]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;Russian forces conducted routine shelling in western Donetsk Oblast and eastern Zaporizhia Oblast, and additional Russian forces deployed to the Zaporizhia Oblast frontline.

Ukrainian state nuclear agency Energoatom stated that Russian shelling damaged the communication equipment and a transformer for reactor number 6.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[34]&lt;/span&gt; Energoatom reported that the damaged transformer cut power to the reactor, forcing two emergency diesel generators to kick in to provide power to the reactor’s cooling pumps. ZNPP employees reportedly enabled an alternate power supply and shut down the emergency generators within an hour of the attack. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that a Ukrainian large-caliber projectile damaged a water pipe of reactor number 5’s safety system and shelling damaged a power line to reactor number 6.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[35]&lt;/span&gt; An image circulated by social media users on September 21 shows a burst water pipe at the ZNPP near the reactor buildings.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[36]&lt;/span&gt; Russian forces continued routine fire against Ukrainian positions on the opposite side of the Kakhovka Reservoir from Enerhodar.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[37]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Russian and Ukrainian sources reported explosions in the Black Sea near Sevastopol, Crimea on September 21.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[38]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt; The Russian-appointed occupation governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev stated that Russian authorities discovered an unmanned water surface vehicle on Soldatskyi Beach and detonated the vehicle, causing the explosion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[39]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Russian federal subjects (regions) are continuing crypto-mobilization efforts regardless of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s declaration of partial mobilization on September 21.

The Ukrainian General Staff also noted that Russian forces are misleading men into entering military service by offering them “construction” jobs in Ukraine. Russian federal subjects will likely continue advertising volunteer service and promising large bonus payments to incentivize more men to volunteer for contract service rather than waiting to be mobilized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Russian forces are also continuing to replenish personnel with prisoner recruits and forcibly mobilized men from proxy areas.

The GUR noted that recruiters select prisoners based on their physical characteristics and previous military experience, regardless of the severity of their crimes.

8, 10:30 pm et click here to see isw’s interactive map of the russian invasion of ukraine. this map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report. a large-scale explosion damaged the kerch strait bridge that links occupied crimea with russia on october 8. maxar satellite imagery shows that the explosion collapsed one lane of the road bridge and damaged the nearby railway track.[1] the russian investigative committee stated that a truck exploded on the bridge and ignited seven fuel tanks on the railroad.[2] a small fraction of russian milbloggers speculated that ukrainian saboteurs used a boat to detonate the bridge from the sea, though there is no visible evidence for such a conclusion.[3] the kremlin refrained from accusing ukraine of sabotage or attack, echoing similar restraint following the sinking of the cruiser moskva and the ukrainian strike on saky airfield in crimea.[4] ukraine did not claim responsibility for the incident, but the new york times reported that an unnamed senior ukrainian official stated that ukrainian intelligence participated in the explosion.[5] kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov noted that the russian president vladimir putin ordered a government commission composed of government officials, security services, and the ministry of emergency situations to investigate the ”emergency.”[6] the explosion will not permanently disrupt critical russian ground lines of communication (glocs) to crimea, but its aftermath is likely to increase friction in russian logistics for some time. the road bridge appears at least partially operational, and the railroad bridge did not suffer significant structural damage according to russian reports that generally seem plausible based on the available video evidence. russian footage shows people walking on the damaged road bridge and a train moving on the railroad bridge.[7] the head of occupied crimea sergey aksyonov claimed that the remaining lane of the road bridge opened to cars and buses after a rigorous security check, but that trucks must move by ferry.[8] the collapsed lane of the road bridge will restrict russian military movements until it is repaired, forcing some russian forces to rely on the ferry connection for some time. russian forces will likely still be able to transport heavy military equipment via the railroad. russian officials will likely intensify security checks on all vehicles crossing the bridge, however, adding delays to the movement of russian military equipment, personnel, and supplies to crimea. putin has already signed a decree strengthening the security protocol on the bridge under the supervision of the russian federal security service (fsb).[9] the kremlin is likely continuing to frame the russian ministry of defense (mod) as the scapegoat for the kerch bridge explosion and other russian military failures to deflect the blame from putin. the russian mod has not issued an official statement regarding the incident as of this publication.[10] russian opposition outlet meduza reported that the russian presidential administration sent out a guide to russian mass media on the appropriate way to downplay the severity of the damage to the bridge, and it is possible that the kremlin has ordered the russian mod to remain quiet regarding the situation.[11] russian propagandist vladimir solovyov stated that russia must initiate a strike campaign on critical ukrainian infrastructure instead of listening to russian mod promises.[12] some nationalist voices noted that putin and his close circle are failing to immediately address the attack on the symbolic bridge, voicing direct criticism of putin for the first time. a milblogger warned that if putin fails to undertake retaliatory actions it “will be mistaken for the weakness of the president himself.”[13] another milblogger noted that it is hypocritical for the kremlin to call on russians to rally behind putin if he is unable to comment on significant events such as the moskva sinking, prisoner exchanges including azovstal fighters, or the collapse of the kharkiv frontline.[14] others criticized the silence of russian deputy chairman of the security council dmitry medvedev regarding the explosion, given that medvedev had made several statements defining any attacks on the kerch bridge as a violation of russian ”red lines.”[15] russian milbloggers and propagandists alike called on the kremlin to resume strikes on ukrainian infrastructure and notably did not make any calls for russia to use tactical nuclear weapons against ukraine. ukrainian and russian sources claimed that the kremlin targeted some higher military command figures following the kerch bridge explosion, but these reports remain unverified as of this publication. the ukrainian main military intelligence directorate (gur) reported that the kremlin detained, arrested, and blocked unspecified military officials and ordered the units of the elite dzerzhinsky separate operation purpose division to enter moscow on october 8.[16] milbloggers who favor the wagner group claimed that the kremlin has replaced russian defense minister sergey shoigu and chief of general staff army general valery gerasimov supposedly with tula governor alexey dyumin and the deputy commander-in-chief of the ground forces, lieutenant general alexander matovnikov, respectively.[17] isw cannot independently verify either of these reports at this time. the kremlin named the russian commander of the aerospace forces, army general sergey surovikin, the new commander of the russian operation in ukraine, and this appointment has generated positive feedback within the nationalist community. sorovikin previously commanded the “southern” group of forces in ukraine and was reportedly responsible for the capture of lysychansk in july.[18] milbloggers shared their excitement regarding surovikin’s appointment, noting that surovikin has the “tough” character necessary to regain the initiative in ukraine.[19] wagner financier yevgeniy prigozhin extravagantly praised surovikin because he “got into a tank and rushed to save” the soviet union during the 1991 coup attempt in moscow.[20] prigozhin’s interview further confirmed reports of a fissure between pro-war and “liberal” factions within the kremlin, which isw will consider in more detail in subsequent reports. key takeaways a large-scale explosion seriously damaged the kerch strait bridge that links occupied crimea with russia. the kremlin named the russian commander of the aerospace forces, army general sergey surovikin, the new commander of the russian operation in ukraine, and this appointment has generated positive feedback within the nationalist community. russian sources claimed that ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in kharkiv and luhansk oblasts. russian forces continued establishing defensive positions in northern kherson oblast. russian forces continued to attack settlements around bakhmut, avdiivka, and west of donetsk city. ukrainian forces reportedly continued to shoot down iranian-made shahed-136 drones. russian federal subjects are facing financial challenges in funding mobilization. russian and occupation administration officials continued measures to remove ukrainian children from their homes in russian-occupied territories. we do not report in detail on russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. we will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in ukrainian urban areas. we utterly condemn these russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, geneva conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports. ukrainian counteroffensives—southern and eastern ukraine russian main effort—eastern ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and two supporting efforts); russian subordinate main effort—capture the entirety of donetsk oblast russian supporting effort—southern axis russian mobilization and force generation efforts activities in russian-occupied areas ukrainian counteroffensives (ukrainian efforts to liberate russian-occupied territories) eastern ukraine: (oskil river-kreminna line) russian sources claimed that ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations from kharkiv oblast in the direction of svatove on october 8. the russian ministry of defense (mod) claimed that russian forces repelled ukrainian assaults southeast of kupyansk.[21] the head of the kharkiv oblast administration, oleg synehubov, reported that russian forces continued to shell kupyansk and surrounding settlements.[22] russian forces continued routine artillery, air, and missile strikes in eastern ukraine in the vicinity of kharkiv city, bohodukhiv, and near izyum.[23] russian sources also claimed that ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in the kreminna direction on october 8. the russian mod claimed that russian forces repelled ukrainian forces attempting to cross the zherebets river at an unspecified location.[24] the donetsk people’s republic (dnr) people’s militia claimed that russian forces maintain full control over the kreminna-svatove highway, despite previous reports of ukrainian forces operating in the area.[25] the russian mod also claimed that russian airstrikes hit two ukrainian concentrations of manpower south of kreminna near siversk and west of kreminna near yampilivka.[26] the russian mod is increasingly including tactical details about ukrainian forces in its claims, likely in response to russian milblogger criticism that they do not report enough on ukrainian advances. isw makes no attempt to evaluate the veracity of the details the russian mod presents about the sizes, echelons, designations, or types of ukrainian units and will not present those details in our reports. ukrainian sources reported that russian forces are continuing to suffer personnel losses in luhansk oblast. the ukrainian general staff reported on october 8 that russian forces transported 300 wounded personnel to a hospital in luhansk oblast.[27] southern ukraine: (kherson oblast) russian forces continued establishing defensive positions in kherson oblast on october 8. ukraine’s southern operational command reported that russian forces continued to shell areas along the line of contact to prevent ukrainian advances and began establishing new defensive lines in the beryslav and nova kakhovka raions.[28] a russian source claimed that ukrainian forces are continuing to consolidate along the front line near davydiv brid and mala oleksandrivka and are equipping strongholds in bezimenne, all near the ukrainian bridgehead over the inhulets river.[29] isw does not attempt to validate russian forecasts of possible ukrainian operations and offers no comment on their plausibility. ukrainian and russian sources reported ongoing battles north and northwest of kherson city, near the ukrainian bridgehead over the inhulets river, and northeast of beryslav on october 8. the ukrainian general staff reported that ukrainian forces repelled a russian ground attack near ternovy pody, roughly 20km northwest of kherson city.[30] ukraine’s southern operational command reported that russian forces unsuccessfully attempted to advance in the area of davydiv brid and mala oleksandrivka near the ukrainian bridgehead over the inhulets river.[31] the russian ministry of defense (mod) claimed that russian forces repelled ukrainian attempts to advance near sukhanove, pyatikhatki, sadok, ishchenka, burskynske, shchaslyve, and mala seidemynykha on the northern kherson oblast frontline.[32] a russian source claimed that russian forces retook pravdyne, 33km northwest of kherson city.[33] a russian source claimed that russian forces repelled a ukrainian ground attack near dudchany on the western bank of the dnipro river.[34] the donetsk people’s republic (dnr) claimed that russian forces maintain positions in snihurivka, mykolaiv oblast, approximately 60km east of mykolaiv city, and reported ongoing fighting on the outskirts of the settlement.[35] ukrainian forces continued their interdiction campaign in kherson oblast to support their southern counteroffensive on october 8. ukraine’s southern operational command reported that ukrainian forces struck three russian concentrations of manpower and equipment and a logistics point in beryslav raion.[36] ukraine's southern operational command also reported that ukrainian aviation struck russian anti-aircraft systems in beryslav and kakhovka raions.[37] geolocated images show that ukrainian forces likely hit five fuel storage facilities near kyselivka, bilozerskyi raion.[38] ukrainian forces reportedly shot down a russian orlan-10 drone in chervone, beryslav raion.[39] the russian mod claimed that land and maritime logistics routes are continuously provisioning russian forces operating in the mykolaiv-kryvyi rih and zaporizhia directions, however.[40] russian main effort—eastern ukraine russian subordinate main effort—donetsk oblast (russian objective: capture the entirety of donetsk oblast, the claimed territory of russia’s proxies in donbas) russian forces continued conducting ground attacks throughout donetsk oblast on october 8. the ukrainian general staff reported that ukrainian forces repelled russian ground attacks on and around bakhmut near vyimka, bilohorivka, bakhmutske, and krasna hora to the north and mayorsk, ozeryanivka, zaitseve, odradivka, and andriivka to the south.[41] a russian milblogger referred to recent russian-claimed gains south of bakhmut of zaitseve and vesela dolyna as a “tactical success.”[42] isw first reported on russian ground attacks against zaitseve and vesela dolyna on august 5 and july 13 respectively, noting that russian forces have taken over two months to be able to claim to have secured two small villages.[43] the ukrainian general staff also reported that ukrainian forces repelled russian ground assaults around avdiivka near pervomaiske, vesele, kamianka, and nevelske, and in western donetsk oblast near pobieda, krasnohorivka, and novomykhailivka.[44] the russian ministry of defense (mod) claimed that russian forces repelled a ukrainian counterattack at an unspecified location in the “south donetsk” direction, possibly referring to the vuhledar, western donetsk oblast area, but there is currently no independent confirmation of the russian mod’s definition of this operational direction.[45] ukrainian forces likely conducted strikes against railway stations in the russian rear in donetsk oblast on october 8. the dnr claimed that ukrainian forces struck a railway station in ilovaisk, donetsk oblast, damaging three diesel fuel tanks for trains and a technical area of the station.[46] russian sources claimed that ukrainian forces struck the karan railway station in andriivka, donetsk oblast, roughly 51km north of mariupol.[47] geolocated footage shows smoke rising from the station area with audible secondary detonations, likely from ammunition.[48] supporting effort—southern axis (russian objective: maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against ukrainian strikes) russian forces continued to conduct routine artillery, air, and missile strikes west of hulyaipole and in dnipropetrovsk and mykolaiv oblasts on october 8.[49] ukrainian sources reported that russian forces attacked zaporizhzhia city, mykolaiv city, ochakiv, and areas of odesa oblast with shahed-136 kamikaze drones but stated that ukrainian forces successfully shot them down.[50] russian forces continued artillery fire and drone strikes against infrastructure in nikopol and marhanets, dnipropetrovsk oblast, on the north bank of the dnipro river.[51] the ukrainian general staff reported that ukrainian forces shelled russian manpower and equipment concentrations in the areas of polohy and tokmak, zaporizhia oblast, and that russian forces suffered at least 85 casualties.[52] russian and ukrainian sources traded accusations of shelling the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (znpp) overnight on october 7-8.[53] russian and ukrainian officials and the international atomic energy agency stated that the shelling cut off the external energy supply to the znpp after engineers had just restored the external power line on october 7.[54] ukrainian enerhodar mayor dmytro orlov later stated that engineers restored power to enerhodar and the surrounding settlements on october 8.[55] russian zaporizhia oblast occupation official vladimir rogov stated that russian atomic energy agency rosatom has already started the process of integrating the znpp into the russian power grid.[56] mobilization and force generation efforts (russian objective: expand combat power without conducting general mobilization) the financial, logistical, and political challenges of supporting the russian mobilization process continue to fuel societal division within russia and criticism of the government. the kremlin and russian ministry of defense (mod) risk alienating core supporters including those supportive of mobilization by failing to address inconsistencies and inadequacies in the implementation of mobilization. the large-scale removal of russian men of working age (either through mobilization or through their flight) has left holes in the positions they formerly filled. a russian source reported on october 6 that the russian ministry of natural resources proposed to exempt garbage collectors and garbage truck drivers from mobilization.[57] forbes reported on october 6 that russian sports centers again petitioned authorities for an exemption to mobilization for coaches and instructors, as mobilization applies to 70% of men employed in the industry.[58] mothers caring for children after the mobilization of their husbands will also face greater non-work demands on their time. a russian source reported on october 6 that the liberal democratic party drafted a bill authorizing the reduction of work hours for mothers with mobilized husbands to 35 hours a week at prior salaries.[59] russian authorities appear to have recognized and attempted to address labor shortages caused by mobilization. the ukrainian general staff reported on october 8 that local authorities in some russian districts are attempting to implement mobilization plans drawing on unemployed men of conscription age.[60] however, the economic gaps left by the sudden removal of part of the russian workforce are likely to continue to create complications. funding mobilization poses an economic challenge to russian regions, as isw has previously reported.[61] russian regions balance pressure to deliver on promises to the mobilized while remaining within their means. a local russian source reported on october 6 that tartarstan deputy finance minister gela gerasimova stated that the budget of tartarstan cannot finance mobilization. gerasimova claimed mobilization will draw on the federal budget.[62] omsk governor aleksandr burkov stated on october 7 that he found an unspecified way to pay each mobilized person 100,000 rubles ($1,603) after previously stating the region's budget could not afford such payments.[63] the costs of mobilization are likely to continue well into 2023, and the long-term viability of such solutions is questionable. poor behavior demonstrated by conscripts brought to training grounds has disturbed nearby communities. a russian source reported on october 7 that residents of mulino raised complaints that the mobilized sent to mulino training grounds drank heavily and walked around the village. isw has previously reported similar complaints in this area.[64] nizhny novgorod governor gleb nikitin has therefore banned the sale of alcohol during mobilization in mulino.[65] reports from october 6 and 7 show a series of women across russia recording video messages asking for help in response to their husbands’ illegal mobilization.[66] isw has previously reported an ongoing pattern of mobilization of russians with disqualifying health and personal circumstances.[67] fontanka saint petersburg reported on october 6 that a housewife in krasnogvardeysky district, saint petersburg, received a mobilization notice.[68] this report is the first that isw has identified detailing the mobilization of a woman without mention of a relevant work background. mobilized soldiers also continue to face extreme conditions. a russian news source counted 15 deaths among the mobilized from various regions prior to deployment to ukraine as of october 7.[69] discrepancies in the level of public concern for newly mobilized units as compared to contract soldiers have likely created a rift in russian society. ukraine’s main military intelligence directorate (gur) published on october 8 a recording of a call between a contract russian soldier and his mother. the mother complained that mobilized units face preferential treatment over volunteer and contract soldiers who have been fighting for months. the mother argued that russian contract soldiers purchased their own equipment and faced the same difficulties as newly mobilized soldiers while the russian public did not care in the same way that they do about the mobilized men. she also noted that contract soldiers faced such difficulties without the 200,000-300,000-ruble ($3,207-4,811) bonus received by the mobilized. the mother directly expressed discontent with the apparent unreachability of putin on issues related to soldiers’ well-being and questioned whether he “even [knows] where our guys are?”[70] isw cannot confirm the extent of such dissatisfaction, but the increasing concessions given to mobilized men in response to broad criticism of the mobilization effort could increase such feelings among contract soldiers, volunteer soldiers, and their families. deputy russian minister of defense viktor goremykin deflected criticism that the russian ministry of defense (mod) is severely undersupplying soldiers by claiming on october 7 that the russian armed forces “have everything necessary to provide for every servicemember in full.”[71] widespread reports of russian mobilized units being forced to purchase their own equipment and clothing, going for days with no food or water, and requesting donations from russian society contradict goremykin’s statement.[72] russian military bloggers publicly mocked goremykin’s false claim and marveled at the ability of the russian mod to continue denying obvious logistical problems. one russian military blogger claimed that the russian mod prioritizes “attempts to create an external gloss” above the lives of soldiers and above the need to win.[73] another military blogger stated that it is no longer possible to replace reality with beautiful reports.[74] blatantly false claims decrease general belief in the credibility of the russian mod and contribute to the growing narrative of mod incompetence. russian authorities appear to be avoiding prosecution of men avoiding military summonses. russian lawyer pavel chikov posted to telegram on october 7 that the penza prosecutor’s office canceled the first criminal case for evasion of mobilization under article 328 of the russian criminal code after launching the case two days before.[75] federation council committee on constitutional legislation and state building head andrey klishas stated on october 7 that it is unlawful to threaten citizens with criminal liability under article 328 for refusal to mobilize.[76] such responses could represent a response to public pressure or challenges in prosecuting all mobilization dodgers. they could also represent the desire to try mobilization dodgers under alternative articles or continue attempts to force dodgers to mobilize rather than sit in prison. activity in russian-occupied areas (russian objective: consolidate administrative control of occupied and annexed areas; forcibly integrate ukrainian civilians into russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems) russian and occupation administration officials continued to increase filtration and law enforcement measures in russian-occupied territories on october 8. the ukrainian resistance center reported on october 8 that russian forces continue filtration activities near positions struck by ukrainian forces to find suspected ukrainian partisans that they believe to be providing ukrainian forces with the positions of russian manpower and equipment concentrations.[77] russian media reported that russian forces in russian-occupied melitopol have increased street inspections of residents’ documents.[78] the ukrainian resistance center reported that russian and occupation administration officials launched a telegram chatbot for reports on the location of ukrainian partisans in the russian-occupied territories.[79] the center also reported that russian federal security service (fsb) personnel increasingly question residents in filtration centers about their participation in the annexation referenda that were held in russian-occupied territories in late september.[80] mayor of melitopol ivan fedorov claimed that occupation administration officials are deporting residents with pro-ukrainian sentiments and transporting them to the vasylivka border checkpoint, but that  russian forces are still not allowing residents to pass through into ukrainian-held zaporizhia oblast.[81] russian and occupation administration officials are likely to increase filtration and law enforcement activities as ukrainian counteroffensives progress. russian and occupation administration officials continued measures to remove ukrainian children from their homes in russian-occupied territories on october 8. the head of the kherson occupation administration vladimir saldo reported that russian-occupied crimea agreed to take over 5,000 children from kherson oblast “on vacation” and that 1,500 of those children have already arrived in crimea.[82] vladimir saldo also announced that the governors of krasnodar krai and stavropol krai stated that their administrations are ready to accept up to 10,000 children from kherson oblast. saldo did not specify a duration for such offers or “vacations.”[83] vladimir saldo stated that the children’s parents would be able to join their children in the territories to which they are sent.[84] note: isw does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on russian, ukrainian, and western reporting and social

This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; A large-scale explosion damaged the Kerch Strait Bridge that links occupied Crimea with Russia on October 8. &lt;/strong&gt;Maxar satellite imagery shows that the explosion collapsed one lane of the road bridge and damaged the nearby railway track.[1] The Russian Investigative Committee stated that a truck exploded on the bridge and ignited seven fuel tanks on the railroad.[2] A small fraction of Russian milbloggers speculated that Ukrainian saboteurs used a boat to detonate the bridge from the sea, though there is no visible evidence for such a conclusion.[3] The Kremlin refrained from accusing Ukraine of sabotage or attack, echoing similar restraint following the sinking of the cruiser &lt;em&gt;Moskva &lt;/em&gt;and the Ukrainian strike on Saky airfield in Crimea.[4] Ukraine did not claim responsibility for the incident, but &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that an unnamed senior Ukrainian official stated that Ukrainian intelligence participated in the explosion.[5] Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov noted that the Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a government commission composed of government officials, security services, and the Ministry of Emergency Situations to investigate the ”emergency.”[6]&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;The explosion will not permanently disrupt critical Russian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) to Crimea, but its aftermath is likely to increase friction in Russian logistics for some time. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;The road bridge appears at least partially operational, and the railroad bridge did not suffer significant structural damage according to Russian reports that generally seem plausible based on the available video evidence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Russian footage shows people walking on the damaged road bridge and a train moving on the railroad bridge.[7] The Head of occupied Crimea Sergey Aksyonov claimed that the remaining lane of the road bridge opened to cars and buses after a rigorous security check, but that trucks must move by ferry.[8] The collapsed lane of the road bridge will restrict Russian military movements until it is repaired, forcing some Russian forces to rely on the ferry connection for some time. Russian forces will likely still be able to transport heavy military equipment via the railroad. Russian officials will likely intensify security checks on all vehicles crossing the bridge, however, adding delays to the movement of Russian military equipment, personnel, and supplies to Crimea. Putin has already signed a decree strengthening the security protocol on the bridge under the supervision of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB).[9]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;The Kremlin is likely continuing to frame the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) as the scapegoat for the Kerch Bridge explosion and other Russian military failures to deflect the blame from Putin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt; The Russian MoD has not issued an official statement regarding the incident as of this publication.[10] Russian opposition outlet &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Meduza&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt; reported that the Russian Presidential Administration sent out a guide to Russian mass media on the appropriate way to downplay the severity of the damage to the bridge, and it is possible that the Kremlin has ordered the Russian MoD to remain quiet regarding the situation.[11] Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov stated that Russia must initiate a strike campaign on critical Ukrainian infrastructure instead of listening to Russian MoD promises.[12]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Some nationalist voices noted that Putin and his close circle are failing to immediately address the attack on the symbolic bridge, voicing direct criticism of Putin for the first time. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;A milblogger warned that if Putin fails to undertake retaliatory actions it “will be mistaken for the weakness of the president himself.”[13] Another milblogger noted that it is hypocritical for the Kremlin to call on Russians to rally behind Putin if he is unable to comment on significant events such as the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Moskva&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt; sinking, prisoner exchanges including Azovstal fighters, or the collapse of the Kharkiv frontline.[14] Others criticized the silence of Russian Deputy Chairman of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev regarding the explosion, given that Medvedev had made several statements defining any attacks on the Kerch Bridge as a violation of Russian ”red lines.”[15] Russian milbloggers and propagandists alike called on the Kremlin to resume strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure and notably did not make any calls for Russia to use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Ukrainian and Russian sources claimed that the Kremlin targeted some higher military command figures following the Kerch Bridge explosion, but these reports remain unverified as of this publication. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;The Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported that the Kremlin detained, arrested, and blocked unspecified military officials and ordered the units of the elite Dzerzhinsky Separate Operation Purpose Division to enter Moscow on October 8.[16] Milbloggers who favor the Wagner Group claimed that the Kremlin has replaced Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Army General Valery Gerasimov supposedly with Tula Governor Alexey Dyumin and the deputy commander-in-chief of the ground forces, Lieutenant General Alexander Matovnikov, respectively.[17] ISW cannot independently verify either of these reports at this time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;The Kremlin named the Russian Commander of the Aerospace Forces, Army General Sergey Surovikin, the new commander of the Russian operation in Ukraine, and this appointment has generated positive feedback within the nationalist community. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Sorovikin previously commanded the “southern” group of forces in Ukraine and was reportedly responsible for the capture of Lysychansk in July.[18] Milbloggers shared their excitement regarding Surovikin’s appointment, noting that Surovikin has the “tough” character necessary to regain the initiative in Ukraine.[19] Wagner financier Yevgeniy Prigozhin extravagantly praised Surovikin because he “got into a tank and rushed to save” the Soviet Union during the 1991 coup attempt in Moscow.[20] Prigozhin’s interview further confirmed reports of a fissure between pro-war and “liberal” factions within the Kremlin, which ISW will consider in more detail in subsequent reports.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul style=\"text-align:

The Russian MoD claimed that Russian forces repelled Ukrainian forces attempting to cross the Zherebets River at an unspecified location.[24] The Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) People’s Militia claimed that Russian forces maintain full control over the Kreminna-Svatove highway, despite previous reports of Ukrainian forces operating in the area.[25] The Russian MoD also claimed that Russian airstrikes hit two Ukrainian concentrations of manpower south of Kreminna near Siversk and west of Kreminna near Yampilivka.[26] The Russian MoD is increasingly including tactical details about Ukrainian forces in its claims, likely in response to Russian milblogger criticism that they do not report enough on Ukrainian advances. ISW makes no attempt to evaluate the veracity of the details the Russian MoD presents about the sizes, echelons, designations, or types of Ukrainian units and will not present those details in our reports.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces are continuing to suffer personnel losses in Luhansk Oblast.

Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command reported that Russian forces continued to shell areas along the line of contact to prevent Ukrainian advances and began establishing new defensive lines in the Beryslav and Nova Kakhovka Raions.[28] A Russian source claimed that Ukrainian forces are continuing to consolidate along the front line near Davydiv Brid and Mala Oleksandrivka and are equipping strongholds in Bezimenne, all near the Ukrainian bridgehead over the Inhulets River.[29] ISW does not attempt to validate Russian forecasts of possible Ukrainian operations and offers no comment on their plausibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Ukrainian and Russian sources reported ongoing battles north and northwest of Kherson City, near the Ukrainian bridgehead over the Inhulets River, and northeast of Beryslav on October 8.

Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command reported that Ukrainian forces struck three Russian concentrations of manpower and equipment and a logistics point in Beryslav Raion.[36] Ukraine's Southern Operational Command also reported that Ukrainian aviation struck Russian anti-aircraft systems in Beryslav and Kakhovka Raions.[37] Geolocated images show that Ukrainian forces likely hit five fuel storage facilities near Kyselivka, Bilozerskyi Raion.[38] Ukrainian forces reportedly shot down a Russian Orlan-10 drone in Chervone, Beryslav Raion.[39] The Russian MoD claimed that land and maritime logistics routes are continuously provisioning Russian forces operating in the Mykolaiv-Kryvyi Rih and Zaporizhia directions, however.[40]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kherson%20and%20Mykolaiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%208%2C%202022.png\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kherson%20and%20Mykolaiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%208%2C%202022.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"688\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;Russian Main Effort—Eastern Ukraine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;Russian Subordinate Main Effort—Donetsk Oblast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russia’s proxies in Donbas)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;Russian forces continued conducting ground attacks throughout Donetsk Oblast on October 8. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian ground attacks on and around Bakhmut near Vyimka, Bilohorivka, Bakhmutske, and Krasna Hora to the north and Mayorsk, Ozeryanivka, Zaitseve, Odradivka, and Andriivka to the south.[41] A Russian milblogger referred to recent Russian-claimed gains south of Bakhmut of Zaitseve and Vesela Dolyna as a “tactical success.”[42] ISW first reported on Russian ground attacks against Zaitseve and Vesela Dolyna on August 5 and July 13 respectively, noting that Russian forces have taken over two months to be able to claim to have secured two small villages.[43] The Ukrainian General Staff also reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian ground assaults around Avdiivka near Pervomaiske, Vesele, Kamianka, and Nevelske, and in western Donetsk Oblast near Pobieda, Krasnohorivka, and Novomykhailivka.[44] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Russian forces repelled a Ukrainian counterattack at an unspecified location in the “South Donetsk” direction, possibly referring to the Vuhledar, western Donetsk Oblast area, but there is currently no independent confirmation of the Russian MoD’s definition of this operational direction.[45]&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;Ukrainian forces likely conducted strikes against railway stations in the Russian rear in Donetsk Oblast on October 8. The DNR claimed that Ukrainian forces struck a railway station in Ilovaisk, Donetsk Oblast, damaging three diesel fuel tanks for trains and a technical area of the station.[46] Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces struck the Karan railway station in Andriivka, Donetsk Oblast, roughly 51km north of Mariupol.[47] Geolocated footage shows smoke rising from the station area with audible secondary detonations, likely from ammunition.[48]&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Donetsk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%208%2C%202022.png\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Donetsk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20October%208%2C%202022.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"759\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;Supporting Effort—Southern Axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Russian forces continued to conduct routine artillery, air, and missile strikes west of Hulyaipole and in Dnipropetrovsk and Mykolaiv Oblasts on October 8.[49] Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces attacked Zaporizhzhia City, Mykolaiv City, Ochakiv, and areas of Odesa Oblast with Shahed-136 kamikaze drones but stated that Ukrainian forces successfully shot them down.[50] Russian forces continued artillery fire and drone strikes against infrastructure in Nikopol and Marhanets, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, on the north bank of the Dnipro River.[51] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces shelled Russian manpower and equipment concentrations in the areas of Polohy and Tokmak, Zaporizhia Oblast, and that Russian forces suffered at least 85 casualties.[52]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Russian and Ukrainian sources traded accusations of shelling the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) overnight on October 7-8.[53] Russian and Ukrainian officials and the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that the shelling cut off the external energy supply to the ZNPP after engineers had just restored the external power line on October 7.[54] Ukrainian Enerhodar Mayor Dmytro Orlov later stated that engineers restored power to Enerhodar and the surrounding settlements on October 8.[55] Russian Zaporizhia Oblast occupation official Vladimir Rogov stated that Russian atomic energy agency Rosatom has already started the process of integrating the ZNPP into the Russian power grid.[56]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt; (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;The financial, logistical, and political challenges of supporting the Russian mobilization process continue to fuel societal division within Russia and criticism of the government. The Kremlin and Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD) risk alienating core supporters including those supportive of mobilization by failing to address inconsistencies and inadequacies in the implementation of mobilization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;The large-scale removal of Russian men of working age (either through mobilization or through their flight) has left holes in the positions they formerly filled. A Russian source reported on October 6 that the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources proposed to exempt garbage collectors and garbage truck drivers from mobilization.[57] Forbes reported on October 6 that Russian sports centers again petitioned authorities for an exemption to mobilization for coaches and instructors, as mobilization applies to 70% of men employed in the industry.[58] Mothers caring for children after the mobilization of their husbands will also face greater non-work demands on their time. A Russian source reported on October 6 that the Liberal Democratic Party drafted a bill authorizing the reduction of work hours for mothers with mobilized husbands to 35 hours a week at prior salaries.[59] Russian authorities appear to have recognized and attempted to address labor shortages caused by mobilization. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on October 8 that local authorities in some Russian districts are attempting to implement mobilization plans drawing on unemployed men of conscription age.[60] However, the economic gaps left by the sudden removal of part of the Russian workforce are likely to continue to create complications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Funding mobilization poses an economic challenge to Russian regions, as ISW has previously reported.[61] Russian regions balance pressure to deliver on promises to the mobilized while remaining within their means. A local Russian source reported on October 6 that Tartarstan Deputy Finance Minister Gela Gerasimova stated that the budget of Tartarstan cannot finance mobilization. Gerasimova claimed mobilization will draw on the federal budget.[62] Omsk Governor Aleksandr Burkov stated on October 7 that he found an unspecified way to pay each mobilized person 100,000 rubles ($1,603) after previously stating the region's budget could not afford such payments.[63] The costs of mobilization are likely to continue well into 2023, and the long-term viability of such solutions is questionable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Poor behavior demonstrated by conscripts brought to training grounds has disturbed nearby communities. A Russian source reported on October 7 that residents of Mulino raised complaints that the mobilized sent to Mulino training grounds drank heavily and walked around the village. ISW has previously reported similar complaints in this area.[64] Nizhny Novgorod Governor Gleb Nikitin has therefore banned the sale of alcohol during mobilization in Mulino.[65]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Reports from October 6 and 7 show a series of women across Russia recording video messages asking for help in response to their husbands’ illegal mobilization.[66] ISW has previously reported an ongoing pattern of mobilization of Russians with disqualifying health and personal circumstances.[67] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Fontanka Saint Petersburg &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;reported on October 6 that a housewife in Krasnogvardeysky District, Saint Petersburg, received a mobilization notice.[68] This report is the first that ISW has identified detailing the mobilization of a woman without mention of a relevant work background.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Mobilized soldiers also continue to face extreme conditions. A Russian news source counted 15 deaths among the mobilized from various regions prior to deployment to Ukraine as of October 7.[69]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Discrepancies in the level of public concern for newly mobilized units as compared to contract soldiers have likely created a rift in Russian society. Ukraine’s Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) published on October 8 a recording of a call between a contract Russian soldier and his mother. The mother complained that mobilized units face preferential treatment over volunteer and contract soldiers who have been fighting for months. The mother argued that Russian contract soldiers purchased their own equipment and faced the same difficulties as newly mobilized soldiers while the Russian public did not care in the same way that they do about the mobilized men. She also noted that contract soldiers faced such difficulties without the 200,000-300,000-ruble ($3,207-4,811)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;bonus received by the mobilized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;The mother directly expressed discontent with the apparent unreachability of Putin on issues related to soldiers’ well-being and questioned whether he “even [knows] where our guys are?”[70] ISW cannot confirm the extent of such dissatisfaction, but the increasing concessions given to mobilized men in response to broad criticism of the mobilization effort could increase such feelings among contract soldiers, volunteer soldiers, and their families.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Deputy Russian Minister of Defense Viktor Goremykin deflected criticism that the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) is severely undersupplying soldiers by claiming on October 7 that the Russian Armed Forces “have everything necessary to provide for every servicemember in full.”[71] Widespread reports of Russian mobilized units being forced to purchase their own equipment and clothing, going for days with no food or water, and requesting donations from Russian society contradict Goremykin’s statement.[72] Russian military bloggers publicly mocked Goremykin’s false claim and marveled at the ability of the Russian MoD to continue denying obvious logistical problems. One Russian military blogger claimed that the Russian MoD prioritizes “attempts to create an external gloss” above the lives of soldiers and above the need to win.[73] Another military blogger stated that it is no longer possible to replace reality with beautiful reports.[74] Blatantly false claims decrease general belief in the credibility of the Russian MoD and contribute to the growing narrative of MoD incompetence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Russian authorities appear to be avoiding prosecution of men avoiding military summonses. Russian lawyer Pavel Chikov posted to Telegram on October 7 that the Penza Prosecutor’s Office canceled the first criminal case for evasion of mobilization under Article 328 of the Russian criminal code after launching the case two days before.[75] Federation Council Committee on Constitutional Legislation and State Building Head Andrey Klishas stated on October 7 that it is unlawful to threaten citizens with criminal liability under Article 328 for refusal to mobilize.[76] Such responses could represent a response to public pressure or challenges in prosecuting all mobilization dodgers. They could also represent the desire to try mobilization dodgers under alternative articles or continue attempts to force dodgers to mobilize rather than sit in prison.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;Activity in Russian-occupied Areas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt; (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of occupied and annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Russian and occupation administration officials continued to increase filtration and law enforcement measures in Russian-occupied territories on October 8. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on October 8 that Russian forces continue filtration activities near positions struck by Ukrainian forces to find suspected Ukrainian partisans that they believe to be providing Ukrainian forces with the positions of Russian manpower and equipment concentrations.[77] Russian media reported that Russian forces in Russian-occupied Melitopol have increased street inspections of residents’ documents.[78] The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported that Russian and occupation administration officials launched a Telegram chatbot for reports on the location of Ukrainian partisans in the Russian-occupied territories.[79] The center also reported that Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) personnel increasingly question residents in filtration centers about their participation in the annexation referenda that were held in Russian-occupied territories in late September.[80] Mayor of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov claimed that occupation administration officials are deporting residents with pro-Ukrainian sentiments and transporting them to the Vasylivka border checkpoint, but that  Russian forces are still not allowing residents to pass through into Ukrainian-held Zaporizhia Oblast.[81] Russian and occupation administration officials are likely to increase filtration and law enforcement activities as Ukrainian counteroffensives progress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Russian and occupation administration officials continued measures to remove Ukrainian children from their homes in Russian-occupied territories on October 8. The Head of the Kherson Occupation Administration Vladimir Saldo reported that Russian-occupied Crimea agreed to take over 5,000 children from Kherson Oblast “on vacation” and that 1,500 of those children have already arrived in Crimea.[82] Vladimir Saldo also announced that the governors of Krasnodar Krai and Stavropol Krai stated that their administrations are ready to accept up to 10,000 children from Kherson Oblast.

       "      <td>russian offensive campaign assessment, april 23 | institute for the study of war skip to main content search form search home who we are research publications get involved planned giving donate russian offensive campaign assessment, april 23 apr 23, 2022 - isw press download the pdf frederick w. kagan, kateryna stepanenko, and karolina hird april 23, 6:30 pm et russian forces continued offensive operations along multiple axes even as they completed moving reinforcements drawn from the retreat from kyiv into the east and continued redeploying some forces from mariupol to the north. the russians have not taken time to refit troops moving from kyiv or mariupol before recommitting them to combat operations. they are not pausing offensive operations to wait until they have concentrated overwhelming combat power, and they do not appear to be massing forces on a few decisive axes of advance. they are continuing the pattern of operations they have followed throughout the war: committing small collections of units to widely dispersed attacks along multiple axes and refusing to accept necessary operational pauses to set conditions for decisive operations. russian forces have thus far only committed a handful of battalion tactical groups (btgs) to offensive operations in their various sectors, however, and could still launch a massed offensive operation. we assess that such an operation is unlikely given observed patterns and the inherent limitations of available actual combat power in troops that have fought hard and suffered many casualties, as well as observed challenges with command-and-control at the regiment/brigade and division level. it is possible that the russians are addressing or attempting to address some of those challenges and will soon launch an offensive in a new and better-coordinated form, but it remains unlikely. the objectives of russian offensives around the izyum-donetsk city salient are unclear. russian forces may seek to reach the izyum-debaltseve road along two or more axes to encircle a large concentration of ukrainian forces and built-up areas. ukrainian officials suggested on april 23 that russian forces near rubizhne and popasna may seek to encircle the severodonetsk-lysychansk area rather than pursue the deeper envelopment. [1] it is too soon to evaluate the likelihood of this russian course of action or the probability of its success. key takeaways russian forces continued their pressure on the azovstal facility in mariupol. russian troops drawn from the retreat from kyiv are re-entering combat in eastern ukraine. russian forces from around mariupol are redeploying to the vicinity of donetsk city and are likely to enter combat again soon and without rest or refit. russia continued conducting small-scale ground offensives at multiple points along the front from izyum to zaporizhia oblast. we do not report in detail on russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. we will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in ukrainian urban areas. we utterly condemn these russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, geneva conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports. isw has updated its assessment of the four primary efforts russian forces are engaged in at this time: main effort—eastern ukraine (comprised of two subordinate supporting efforts); supporting effort 1—kharkiv and izyum; supporting effort 2—southern axis; supporting effort 3—sumy and northeastern ukraine. main effort—eastern ukraine subordinate main effort—mariupol (russian objective: capture mariupol and reduce the ukrainian defenders) russian forces continued to attack ukrainian defenders in the azovstal steel plant and are likely attempting to starve out those remaining within the facility. [2] advisor to the head of the ukrainian president’s office oleksiy arestovych stated that russian troops tried to storm the plant and “strangle” ukrainian resistance, though isw cannot independently verify this claim. [3] russian forces allegedly organized buses for civilian evacuation from mariupol but canceled the evacuation on the grounds that ukrainian ”nationalists” were planning on attacking the civilians. [4] such actions that spoil the evacuation process likely represent further attempts to shape the information space in mariupol and globally, as well as to extend administrative control in captured portions of the city. [5] subordinate main effort—donetsk and luhansk oblasts (russian objective: capture the entirety of donetsk and luhansk oblasts, the claimed territory of russia’s proxies in donbas) russian forces conducted limited ground offensives in rubizhne, popasna, and marinka on april 23 but did not make any significant territorial gains. [6] the ukrainian general staff said that russian forces are focusing on preparing to assault severodonetsk while continuing unsuccessful ground attacks in the direction of slovyansk and shelling settlements all along the frontline. [7] social media users and foreign journalists geolocated russian forces to the northeastern part of rubizhne, where street fighting continued as of april 23. [8] russian forces paused offensive operations on avdiivka, just north of donetsk city, after consistently targeting the settlement throughout the week. donetsk people’s republic (dnr) and russian units have reportedly been arriving in the vicinity of donetsk city from mariupol since april 21, and the russian command will likely recommit these degraded units to offensives in donetsk and luhansk oblasts. [9] supporting effort #1—kharkiv and izyum: (russian objective: advance southeast to support russian operations in luhansk oblast; defend ground lines of communication (glocs) to the izyum axis) russian forces conducted ground attacks from izyum on april 23. [10] arestovych said that russian troops seized lozove, approximately 35 km east of izyum, on april 23. [11] the ukrainian general staff reported that elements of the 35th combined arms army’s 1st tank army and the 68th army corps are participating in active combat in the area as of april 23. [12] the ukrainian general staff stated that elements of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade of the 35th combined arms army, which had fought in bucha, are operating in the vicinity of izyum. [13] elements of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade sustained losses while fighting on the kyiv axis earlier in the invasion, redeployed to the izyum axis quickly, and therefore likely add limited combat power to the fight. [14] russian forces maintained their positions northeast of kharkiv city and continued to shell surrounding areas on april 23. [15] reports of russian reinforcements from the kyiv axis in kharkiv oblast likely indicate that russia intends to maintain pressure on kharkiv city, contradicting the russian claim that moscow’s focus is on securing the borders of luhansk and donetsk oblasts. russian ground lines of communication (glocs) do not currently run through or even near kharkiv city, and the most recent ukrainian counteroffensives near the city are unlikely to threaten russian glocs from belgorod to izyum. supporting effort #2—southern axis: (russian objective: defend kherson against ukrainian counterattacks) russian forces continued a limited offensive in zaporizhia oblast but paused ground offensive operations in northern kherson oblast on april 23. [16] oleksiy arestovych, chief advisor to ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky, said that russian forces advanced several kilometers in the direction of hulyaipole, zaporizhia oblast, likely intending to stop ukrainian counteroffensives in the area or to secure the n15 highway. [17] the ukrainian general staff reported that one russian btg from the 19th motorized rifle division of the 58th combined arms army moved in the direction of zaporizhia. this unit was likely one of three sent to melitopol early in march and is not likely a fresh unit, although it may have had time to refit and replace losses. [18] russian forces are reportedly regrouping separate units of the 8th and 49th combined arms armies, the 22nd army corps, black sea coastal troops, and airborne troops to retain occupied frontiers in southern ukraine. [19] ukraine’s military intelligence directorate claimed that ukrainian forces struck a command post of the 49th combined arms army in an unspecified frontline location in southern ukraine on april 22, killing at least two generals and destroying the post. [20] isw cannot independently verify this strike or its casualties. the ukrainian resistance center also reported that an organized resistance movement has killed 100 russian occupation personnel since the start of the war, including 30 since april 12. [21] russian forces are attempting to forcibly mobilize residents of temporarily occupied settlements in kherson and zaporizhia oblasts, despite growing resistance movements. [22] supporting effort #3—sumy and northeastern ukraine: (russian objective: withdraw combat power in good order for redeployment to eastern ukraine) there was no significant change in this area in the past 24 hours. immediate items to watch russian forces will likely continue attacking southeast from izyum, west from kreminna and popasna, and north from donetsk city via avdiivka or another axis. russian forces will attempt to starve out the remaining defenders of the azovstal steel plant in mariupol and will not allow trapped civilians to evacuate. russian forces will likely increase the scale of ground offensive operations in the coming days, but it is too soon to tell how fast they will do so or how large those offensives will be. it is also too soon to assess how the russians will weight their efforts in the arc from izyum to donetsk city. correction: a previous version of this report stated that russian troops seized lozova, kharkiv oblast, approximately 100km west of izyum. russian troops actually seized lozove, donetsk oblast, approximately 35km east of izyum.</td>\n",

They are not pausing offensive operations to wait until they have concentrated overwhelming combat power, and they do not appear to be massing forces on a few decisive axes of advance. They are continuing the pattern of operations they have followed throughout the war: committing small collections of units to widely dispersed attacks along multiple axes and refusing to accept necessary operational pauses to set conditions for decisive operations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Russian forces have thus far only committed a handful of battalion tactical groups (BTGs) to offensive operations in their various sectors, however, and could still launch a massed offensive operation. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;We assess that such an operation is unlikely given observed patterns and the inherent limitations of available actual combat power in troops that have fought hard and suffered many casualties, as well as observed challenges with command-and-control at the regiment/brigade and division level. It is possible that the Russians are addressing or attempting to address some of those challenges and will soon launch an offensive in a new and better-coordinated form, but it remains unlikely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;The objectives of Russian offensives around the Izyum-Donetsk City salient are unclear. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"&gt;Russian forces may seek to reach the Izyum-Debaltseve road along two or more axes to encircle a large concentration of Ukrainian forces and built-up areas.

[1] putin and shoigu presented the capture of lysychansk and luhansk oblast as a major victory for russian forces in ukraine. putin also stated that the russian units that participated in the battle for lysychansk should rest to increase their combat capabilities. [2] putin‘s public comment was likely meant to signal his concern for the welfare of his troops in the face of periodic complaints in russia about the treatment of russian soldiers. his comment was also likely accurate—russian troops that fought through severodonetsk and lysychansk very likely do need a significant period in which to rest and refit before resuming large-scale offensive operations. it is not clear, however, that the russian military will accept the risks of a long enough operational pause to allow these likely exhausted forces to regain their strength. former russian military commander igor girkin, an ardent russian nationalist who commanded militants during the 2014 war in donbas, posted a scathing critique of the kremlin’s handling of the war on his telegram channel and questioned the significance of the seizure of lysychansk. he suggested that russian forces had paid too high a price for a limited gain. in a series of telegram posts published prior to putin’s meeting with shoigu on july 4, girkin complained that russian forces have failed to meet the announced goals of the “second stage of the special operation” (the operations in eastern ukraine following russia’s retreat from kyiv) to his nearly 400,000 subscribers. [3] girkin noted that the ukrainian defense of lysychansk was deliberately designed to inflict maximum damage on russian troops and burn through russian manpower and equipment. he strongly suggested that accepting battle on the ukrainians‘ terms was a significant misstep by the russian leadership. [4] girkin stated (before putin’s remarks were made public) that russian troops need time to rest and replenish in order to recover their offensive potential and noted that the lack of individual soldier replacements and unit rotations is severely degrading morale. he warned, however, that taking time to reconstitute offensive capability would allow ukrainian troops to seize the initiative and further threaten russian gains. [5] girkin additionally claimed that russian forces have limited prospects of advancing elsewhere in ukraine due to ukrainian personnel and equipment superiority. [6] girkin’s critique is a noteworthy example of the way russian milbloggers and military enthusiasts have become disillusioned with the kremlin’s handling and execution of operations in ukraine, particularly after the dramatic failed river crossing attempt at bilohorivka in early may. [7] girkin’s statements directly undermine the kremlin’s efforts to frame lysychansk as a significant victory or turning point and show that the disillusionment amongst ultra-nationalist elements in the russian information space continues to run deep. girkin’s assessment of russian military failures notably aligns with much of isw’s (and other western agencies’ and experts’) analysis, suggesting that he and some other milbloggers continue to make and publish assessments of the situation and forecasts independent of the kremlin line. girkin likely hopes to use his status as a prominent former participant in the war in donbas in 2014 to persuade putin to take certain measures to secure russian success in a war that girkin still thinks is justified and necessary—specifically mobilizing the russian population for war on a much larger scale. [8] girkin, along with other members of the russian nationalist milblogger space, will likely continue to offer critiques of the kremlin’s line on operations in ukraine to advocate for general mobilization and more competent russian military leadership. ukrainian forces are increasingly targeting russian military infrastructure with indirect fire and us-provided himars systems deep in occupied territory. ukrainian forces reportedly struck russian ammunition depots in dibrivne, kharkiv oblast, (close to the frontline) on july 4 and snizhne, donetsk oblast, (approximately 75 km from the frontlines) overnight on july 3-4 following a strike on one of four russian ammunition depots in melitopol on july 3. [9] the ukrainian general staff also published a video on july 4 of a ukrainian himars (high mobility artillery rocket system) operating in an unspecified area of zaporizhia oblast. [10] the increased ability of ukrainian forces to target critical russian military facilities with western-provided himars demonstrates how western military aid provides ukraine with new and necessary military capabilities. key takeaways russian leadership may be setting conditions for an operational pause following the seizure of lysychansk and the luhansk oblast boundary. russian forces are consolidating territorial and administrative control over severodonetsk and lysychansk. russian forces continued offensive operations to the east of bakhmut to prepare for advances on bakhmut and siversk. russian forces continued limited and unsuccessful assaults north of kharkiv city. ukrainian partisan activity is targeting russian railway lines around melitopol and tokmak. russian leadership may be setting conditions for the conscription of ukrainian citizens living in occupied territories. we do not report in detail on russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. we will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in ukrainian urban areas. we utterly condemn these russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, geneva conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports. main effort—eastern ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and three supporting efforts) subordinate main effort—encirclement of ukrainian troops in the cauldron between izyum and donetsk and luhansk oblasts supporting effort 1—kharkiv city supporting effort 2—southern axis mobilization and force generation efforts activities in russian-occupied areas main effort—eastern ukraine subordinate main effort—southern kharkiv, donetsk, luhansk oblasts (russian objective: encircle ukrainian forces in eastern ukraine and capture the entirety of donetsk and luhansk oblasts, the claimed territory of russia’s proxies in donbas) russian forces took measures to consolidate control of captured territory around severodonetsk and lysychansk on july 4. [11] the russian ministry of defense announced that russian forces completed the capture of luhansk oblast with the capture of lysychansk. [12] the ukrainian general staff reported that russian troops are fortifying their positions around lysychansk and bilohorivka. [13] severodonetsk mayor oleksandr stryuk also noted that russian forces are trying to establish an administrative presence in severodonetsk and have established a commandant’s office to replace the local government. [14] russian forces will likely begin to institute administrative occupational control over severodonetsk and lysychansk. russian forces continued offensive operations to the east of bakhmut on july 4 to prepare for subsequent offensive operations toward bakhmut and siversk. [15] the ukrainian general staff reported that russian forces conducted a reconnaissance in force on the outskirts of berestove and undertook offensive operations around the vuhledar power plant, vasylivka, spirne, klynove, and mayorsk. [16] russian forces will likely continue efforts to move west of the t1302 bakhmut-lysychansk highway to eventually drive on bakhmut and siversk, although their ability to do so successfully following losses sustained during attempts to take lysychansk is questionable. [17] nasa’s fire information for resource management system (firms) remotely sensed data showed fires near spirne, klynove, and the vuhledar power plant on july 4, consistent with the ukrainian general staff’s reports. [source: nasa’s fire information for resource management system, july 4] russian forces conducted limited ground assaults southwest of donetsk city to improve their tactical position in the donetsk city-avdiivka area on july 4. [18] the ukrainian general staff reported that russian forces conducted assaults in the direction of pobeda and mariinka, just southwest of donetsk city. russian forces have reportedly occupied the dominant heights surrounding novoselivka druha (10km northeast of avdiivka) and are using this position to exert fire control over avdiivka. [19] russian forces continued offensive operations northwest of slovyansk near the kharkiv-donetsk oblast border and made incremental gains on july 4. [20] the ukrainian general staff stated that russian forces had “partial success” in mazanivka, about 20 km northwest of slovyansk, and fought in bohorodychne and dolyna. [21] russian forces also reportedly redeployed a battalion tactical group (btg) from izyum to snizhkivka- just south of izyum in the direction of barvinkove, which may suggest that russian forces are preparing for renewed offensives southeast of izyum towards barvinkove. nasa firms data for july 4 showed large concentrations of heat anomalies in the wooded areas to the southeast of izyum indicating probable locations for russian indirect fire and ukrainian counterbattery fires. [source: nasa’s fire information for resource management system, july 4] supporting effort #1—kharkiv city (russian objective: defend ground lines of communication (glocs) to izyum and prevent ukrainian forces from reaching the russian border) russian forces did not make any territorial gains on the kharkiv city axis on july 4. ukrainian sources reported that ukrainian forces repelled russian assaults on prudyanka along the t2117 highway and sosnivka, less than 10 km from the russian border. [22] russian forces continued air, artillery, and rocket strikes on ukrainian military infrastructure and settlements north, northeast, and east of kharkiv city. [23] russian telegram channel rybar claimed that ukrainian forces conducted spoiling attacks, likely small reconnaissance in force operations, on russian positions near kozacha lopan, east of udy. [24] the ukrainian general staff reported that russian ground forces with aviation support on the kharkiv city axis are focusing on restraining any ukrainian offensive operations. [25] the russian defense ministry claimed that russian forces destroyed the temporary deployment points of the ukrainian 92nd mechanized and 40th artillery brigades in kharkiv city. [26] supporting effort #2—southern axis (russian objective: defend kherson and zaporizhia oblasts against ukrainian counterattacks) russian forces focused on regaining lost positions in northeastern kherson oblast on july 4. the ukrainian general staff reported russian attacks on ivanivka, potemkyne, and myrne. [27] russian forces reportedly deployed 17 railway wagons with ammunition from crimea to northern kherson oblast, likely to resupply russian artillery units. [28] nasa’s firms data showed abnormally high numbers of fires along the mykolaiv-kherson oblast frontline on july 4, indicating intense indirect fire attacks. russian and ukrainian forces continued shelling across the line of contact along the entire southern axis on july 4. [29] [source: nasa’s fire information for resource management system, july 4] [source: nasa’s fire information for resource management system, july 4] a ukrainian partisan campaign may be targeting russian rail lines near melitopol in zaporizhia oblast. the ukrainian resistance center reported that ukrainian partisans blew up a railway bridge near occupied lyubimivka between melitopol and tokmak, zaporizhia oblast on july 3, likely obstructing russian resupply efforts from crimea to the zaporizhia oblast front line. [30] ukrainian partisans derailed a separate russian armored train carrying ammunition near melitopol on july 2. [31] ukrainian partisans had previously targeted russian armored trains and locomotives in melitopol in late april and mid-may. [32] this pattern of reported activity may indicate a coordinated partisan campaign targeting russian rail lines. mobilization and force-generation efforts (russian objective: expand combat power without conducting general mobilization) russian leaders may be preparing to mobilize ukrainian citizens in occupied areas. the representative of the ukrainian president in crimea stated on july 3 that the russian administration in crimea issued a decree creating a “conscription commission for the mobilization of citizens in the republic of crimea,” which would allow russian authorities to forcibly mobilize residents of crimea to fight against ukraine. [33] while the status of crimea under russian federation law (but not under ukrainian or international law) is distinct from the areas of eastern and southern ukraine that have been occupied since february 24, this decree may set an internal russian precedent for russian authorities to begin forced mobilization campaigns throughout occupied parts of ukraine to support force generation efforts in the coming months. activity in russian-occupied areas (russian objective: consolidate administrative control of occupied areas; set conditions for potential annexation into the russian federation or some other future political arrangement of moscow’s choosing) russian authorities continued to set conditions for various annexation scenarios on july 4. director of ukraine’s main intelligence directorate (gur) kyrylo budanov stated that russia is preparing several annexation scenarios before september 11, the suggested date for the annexation of ukrainian territory into the russian federation. [34] budanov claimed that russia may be preparing to join ukrainian territories to russia, create one large ”people’s republic,” or annex individual territories to russia. the suggestion of a singular, large ”people’s republic” is novel and has not yet been discussed by ukrainian or russian authorities. a single ”people’s republic” likely indicates that the kremlin continues to hold territorial aspirations beyond the donbas.

This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Russian President Vladimir Putin celebrated the Russian seizure of Lysychansk and the Luhansk Oblast border and appeared to direct the Russian military to conduct an operational pause. &lt;/strong&gt;Putin met with Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu on July 4 to discuss recent Russian gains in Luhansk Oblast and presented Colonel General Alexander Lapin and Major General Esedulla Abachev with the “Hero of Russia” award for their leadership during the Lysychansk operation.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt; Putin and Shoigu presented the capture of Lysychansk and Luhansk Oblast as a major victory for Russian forces in Ukraine. Putin also stated that the Russian units that participated in the battle for Lysychansk should rest to increase their combat capabilities.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt; Putin‘s public comment was likely meant to signal his concern for the welfare of his troops in the face of periodic complaints in Russia about the treatment of Russian soldiers. His comment was also likely accurate—Russian troops that fought through Severodonetsk and Lysychansk very likely do need a significant period in which to rest and refit before resuming large-scale offensive operations. It is not clear, however, that the Russian military will accept the risks of a long enough operational pause to allow these likely exhausted forces to regain their strength.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Former Russian military commander Igor Girkin, an ardent Russian nationalist who commanded militants during the 2014 war in Donbas, posted a scathing critique of the Kremlin’s handling of the war on his Telegram channel and questioned the significance of the seizure of Lysychansk. He suggested that Russian forces had paid too high a price for a limited gain. &lt;/strong&gt;In a series of Telegram posts published prior to Putin’s meeting with Shoigu on July 4, Girkin complained that Russian forces have failed to meet the announced goals of the “second stage of the special operation” (the operations in eastern Ukraine following Russia’s retreat from Kyiv) to his nearly 400,000 subscribers.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt; Girkin noted that the Ukrainian defense of Lysychansk was deliberately designed to inflict maximum damage on Russian troops and burn through Russian manpower and equipment. He strongly suggested that accepting battle on the Ukrainians‘ terms was a significant misstep by the Russian leadership.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt; Girkin stated (before Putin’s remarks were made public) that Russian troops need time to rest and replenish in order to recover their offensive potential and noted that the lack of individual soldier replacements and unit rotations is severely degrading morale. He warned, however, that taking time to reconstitute offensive capability would allow Ukrainian troops to seize the initiative and further threaten Russian gains.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt; Girkin additionally claimed that Russian forces have limited prospects of advancing elsewhere in Ukraine due to Ukrainian personnel and equipment superiority.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Girkin’s critique is a noteworthy example of the way Russian milbloggers and military enthusiasts have become disillusioned with the Kremlin’s handling and execution of operations in Ukraine, particularly after the dramatic failed river crossing attempt at Bilohorivka in early May.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[7]&lt;/span&gt; Girkin’s statements directly undermine the Kremlin’s efforts to frame Lysychansk as a significant victory or turning point and show that the disillusionment amongst ultra-nationalist elements in the Russian information space continues to run deep. Girkin’s assessment of Russian military failures notably aligns with much of ISW’s (and other Western agencies’ and experts’) analysis, suggesting that he and some other milbloggers continue to make and publish assessments of the situation and forecasts independent of the Kremlin line. Girkin likely hopes to use his status as a prominent former participant in the war in Donbas in 2014 to persuade Putin to take certain measures to secure Russian success in a war that Girkin still thinks is justified and necessary—specifically mobilizing the Russian population for war on a much larger scale.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[8]&lt;/span&gt; Girkin, along with other members of the Russian nationalist milblogger space, will likely continue to offer critiques of the Kremlin’s line on operations in Ukraine to advocate for general mobilization and more competent Russian military leadership.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian forces are increasingly targeting Russian military infrastructure with indirect fire and US-provided HIMARS systems deep in occupied territory. &lt;/strong&gt;Ukrainian forces reportedly struck Russian ammunition depots in Dibrivne, Kharkiv Oblast, (close to the frontline) on July 4 and Snizhne, Donetsk Oblast, (approximately 75 km from the frontlines) overnight on July 3-4 following a strike on one of four Russian ammunition depots in Melitopol on July 3.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[9]&lt;/span&gt; The Ukrainian General Staff also published a video on July 4 of a Ukrainian HIMARS (high mobility artillery rocket system) operating in an unspecified area of Zaporizhia Oblast.&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;[10]&lt;/span&gt; The increased ability of Ukrainian forces to target critical Russian military facilities with Western-provided HIMARS demonstrates how Western military aid provides Ukraine with new and necessary military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian leadership may be setting conditions for an operational pause following the seizure of Lysychansk and the Luhansk Oblast boundary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian forces are consolidating territorial and administrative control over Severodonetsk and Lysychansk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian forces continued offensive operations to the east of Bakhmut to prepare for advances on Bakhmut and Siversk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian forces continued limited and unsuccessful assaults north of Kharkiv City.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian partisan activity is targeting Russian railway lines around Melitopol and Tokmak.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian leadership may be setting conditions for the conscription of Ukrainian citizens living in occupied territories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/DraftUkraineCoTJuly4%2C2022.png\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/DraftUkraineCoTJuly4%2C2022.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"706\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting.

[1] at least a portion of the provided drones are older-generation “shahed 129” heavy strike drones, which russian forces may seek to use to attack us-provided himars in ukraine. [2] it is unclear whether the 46 drones represent all the drones that tehran has agreed to send, or the number of iranian drones that are currently operating in ukraine. key takeaways ukrainian officials confirmed that russian forces are using iranian-provided drones in ukraine. russian forces conducted unsuccessful ground assaults on settlements south of bakhmut. russian and ukrainian forces exchanged heavy artillery fire in pisky, suggesting that russian forces are unlikely to have full control of pisky despite russian claims. russian forces conducted several limited ground assaults to the north, northwest, and southwest of donetsk city. russian and ukrainian forces accused each other of firing rounds near the zaporizhia nuclear power plant (npp) in enerhodar, but isw cannot independently determine which party is responsible for the incident. russian forces have repeatedly used artillery systems deliberately positioned within the complex to fire on targets across the dnipro river. russian forces unsuccessfully attempted to advance on lozove, kherson oblast, likely targeting the ukrainian bridgehead over the inhulets river. russian federal subjects are forming new volunteer battalions in omsk and samara oblasts. russian occupation authorities are likely accelerating passportization and rubleization efforts and civilian data collection in occupied territories in preparation for the upcoming pseudo-referenda on the annexation of occupied ukrainian territory into russia. the kremlin is continuing to replace ukrainian collaborators in russian occupation administrations with russian officials, likely to prepare for formal russian governance of annexed areas. we do not report in detail on russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. we will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in ukrainian urban areas. we utterly condemn these russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, geneva conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports. main effort—eastern ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and two supporting efforts); subordinate main effort—encirclement of ukrainian troops in the cauldron between izyum and donetsk and luhansk oblasts supporting effort 1—kharkiv city supporting effort 2—southern axis mobilization and force generation efforts activities in russian-occupied areas main effort—eastern ukraine subordinate main effort—southern kharkiv, donetsk, luhansk oblasts (russian objective: encircle ukrainian forces in eastern ukraine and capture the entirety of donetsk and luhansk oblasts, the claimed territory of russia’s proxies in donbas) russian forces did not conduct any confirmed ground attacks between izyum and slovyansk on august 5. the ukrainian general staff reported that russian forces shelled settlements along the kharkiv-donetsk oblast border northwest of slovyansk, including bohorodychne, dolyna, dibrivne, mazanivka, adamivka, and kurulka. [3] russian forces continued offensive operations in the siversk area on august 5. the ukrainian general staff stated that russian troops are engaged in small arms fire near siversk in addition to continued artillery strikes on siversk city and surrounding settlements. [4] russian forces conducted ground attacks south of bakhmut on august 5. the ukrainian general staff reported that russian troops unsuccessfully attempted to gain ground and improve their tactical positions in zaitseve and vershyna, both within 5km of the southern outskirts of bakhmut. [5] several russian milbloggers claimed that russian forces are actively fighting at the knauf gips donbas gypsum factory on the southeastern outskirts of soledar, about 8km northeast of bakhmut and directly along the t1302 bakhmut-lysychansk highway. [6] ukrainian sources stated that russian troops are struggling to get through ukrainian defenses surrounding bakhmut, and russian forces will likely continue to impale themselves on fortified ukrainian positions under the cover of heavy artillery fire without securing large gains rapidly. [7] russian forces conducted several limited ground attacks to the north and west of donetsk city on august 5. the ukrainian general staff stated that russian troops unsuccessfully attempted to advance towards krasnohorivka (15km north of donetsk city), avdiivka (about 6km north of donetsk city), and pisky (about 5km northwest of donetsk city). [8] despite claims made by russian sources that russian troops have taken complete control of pisky, geolocated videos from the area suggest that pisky remains under heavy artillery fire from all sides, which means that russian forces likely have not yet been able to actually establish full control of urban parts of pisky itself. [9] russian troops also unsuccessfully attempted to advance on marinka, directly on the southwestern outskirts of donetsk city. [10] luhansk people’s republic (lnr) deputy internal minister vitaly kiselev claimed that separate dnr brigades and wagner group forces took control of half of marinka. [11] while isw cannot independently confirm the status of block-to-block control of marinka, russian troops will likely attempt to advance through the town from positions in the petrovskyi district of donetsk city. supporting effort #1—kharkiv city (russian objective: defend ground lines of communication (glocs) to izyum and prevent ukrainian forces from reaching the russian border) russian forces continued to focus on preventing ukrainian forces from creating conditions to resume a counteroffensive on the kharkiv city axis on august 5. russian forces continued to conduct aerial reconnaissance and engage ukrainian forces in positional battles in settlements northwest of kharkiv city but did not make any territorial gains. [12] russian forces continued shelling kharkiv city and settlements to the northeast, northwest, and southeast. [13] supporting effort #2—southern axis (russian objective: defend kherson and zaporizhia oblasts against ukrainian counterattacks) russian forces continued to launch unsuccessful assaults in northwestern kherson oblast, likely targeting the ukrainian bridgehead over the inhulets river. ukrainian military officials reported that two russian platoon-sized units consisting of spetsnaz and tank elements unsuccessfully attempted to advance onto lozove, situated on the eastern inhulets river bank. [14] russian forces also continued to launch airstrikes near lozove, velyke artakove, and andiivka, all in the vicinity of the ukrainian bridgehead. [15] russian forces have also intensified aerial reconnaissance and maintained heavy artillery fire along the line of contact on the kherson oblast administrative border. [16] russian forces continued to target nikopol, mykolaiv city, dnipropetrovsk, and odesa oblasts with artillery, mlrs, and missile strikes on august 5. dnipropetrovsk oblast regional authorities reported that russian forces launched approximately 60 rockets from grad mlrs systems at nikopol’s civilian infrastructure and struck myrivska hromada (community district) with a kh-59 cruise missile. [17] mykolaiv oblast officials reported that russian forces shelled mykolaiv city with pion heavy artillery. [18] the ukrainian general staff also reported that russian forces launched a missile strike on unspecified infrastructure in mykolaivka on the odesa-mykolaiv oblast border. [19] russian and ukrainian officials accused each other of firing rounds near the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (npp) in enerhodar on august 5. ukrainian state nuclear power enterprise energoatom reported that russian forces conducted another artillery provocation and damaged three high-voltage communications lines of the zaporizhzhia npp autotransformer near the plant’s industrial site. [20] enerhodar mayor dmytro orlov also noted that russian forces shelled enerhodar’s residential neighborhoods from the direction of the zaporizhzhia npp, resulting in power outages in most neighborhoods. [21] russian occupation authorities in enerhodar claimed that ukrainian artillery shelled the territory of the zaporizhzhia npp, damaging two power lines that are necessary for the operation of power units in the city. [22] isw cannot independently determine which party is responsible for the incident, however, russian forces are likely continuing to use positions around the zaporizhzhia npp to shell nikopol just across the kakhovka reservoir. the uk defense ministry also assessed that russian forces are using facilities at the zaporizhzhia npp and in enerhodar city as a sanctuary in which to rest and protect their equipment from ukrainian strikes, given the protected status of the npp. [23] ukrainian forces likely continued to target russian ammunition depots and positions in kherson oblast. the ukrainian southern operational command reported destroying three russian ammunition depots in kherson city, and in prydniprovske and tokarivka (both situated east of kherson city along the dnipro river). [24] ukrainian telegram channel operativnyi zsu reported that ukrainian forces have struck two unspecified military infrastructure objects in oleshky and nova kakhovka with high-precision weapons. [25] ukrainian forces reportedly destroyed four russian s-300 air defense missile systems, and geolocated footage showed ukrainian missile units destroying russian armored personnel carriers in starosillya along the t2207 ground line of communication (glocs). [26] local social media users reported on and published footage suggesting that russian forces seized kherson city clinical hospital after ukrainian strikes on a russian base in kherson city in mid-july and are unloading military equipment in the building. [27] mobilization and force generation efforts ( russian objective: expand combat power without conducting general mobilization) russian sources confirmed the formation of the 3rd army corps on august 5. russian milblogger and military correspondent sasha kots announced recruitment for the “samara” volunteer battalion in samara oblast and noted that the battalion will join the 3rd army corps of the russian armed forces. [28] the battalion is recruiting men between the ages of 18 and 50 who have completed at least middle or high school education, without required prior military experience. [29] isw has previously reported that ukrainian officials believed that russian forces were forming a 15,500-person-strong 3 rd army corps within the western military district (wmd) based out of mulino, nizhny novgorod oblast, but did not have official confirmation of its formation from russian sources. [30] sasha kots’ announcement also indicates that the kremlin is likely planning to compose the 3rd army corps at least in part from volunteer battalions. russian federal subjects (regions) continued to form regionally-based volunteer battalions. omsk oblast governor aleksandr butkov reported on august 5 that omsk oblast is continuing to form three volunteer battalions - “irtysh,” “avangard,” and “om” - to deploy to donbas to provide engineering, medical and logistical support. [31] butkov stated that omsk oblast will provide a one-time payment of 100,000 rubles (approximately $1,612) to recruits but specified that the funds will only be accessible after three months of service.[32] omsk oblast news outlet bk55 reported that recruits will receive a monthly salary is 40,000 to 50,000 (approximately $661-$826) which will increase to 130,000 (approximately $2,147) once they enter the territory of ukraine. [33] russian forces continued to face low morale issues within its federal republics. russian telegram channel rybar stated that the akbuzat movement (a human rights activism movement) in the russian republic of bashkortostan is calling on bashkortostan servicemen to terminate their contracts with the russian armed forces.[34] rybar reported that akbuzat leadership is offering legal assistance to those who break their contracts. rybar condemned the movement and accused the akbuzat leadership of sharing the personal data of applicants with third-parties, including the security service of ukraine (sbu).[35] activity in russian-occupied areas (russian objective: consolidate administrative control of occupied areas; set conditions for potential annexation into the russian federation or some other future political arrangement of moscow’s choosing) russian occupation authorities are dramatically expanding their passportization of occupied ukrainian territories by requiring ukrainian civilians to acquire russian passports to participate in basic life activities. occupation authorities are also increasingly requiring the use of the russian ruble rather than the ukrainian hryvnia and will likely begin levying russian taxes on ukrainian residents of occupied areas. ukraine’s main military intelligence directorate (gur) reported on august 5 that russian occupation authorities in melitopol are forcing ukrainian tenants who rent plots of agricultural land to negotiate new rental agreements, even if their agreements remain active. [36] renegotiation of their rental agreements requires a russian passport. the gur also reported that russian occupation authorities are requiring all ukrainian vehicle license plates to transfer to temporary russian-style license plates and to re-register their vehicles in a russian system. re-registration will require a russian passport. the gur also reported that the russian-appointed minister of agrarian policy for kherson oblast, ukrainian collaborator oleksii kovalev, ordered kherson farmers to register their businesses and pay taxes under russian law. the gur also reported that russian authorities sent letters to businesspeople and self-employed residents of kamianske, zaporizhia oblast requesting that they register their businesses and begin paying russian taxes. registration of business activity will require a russian passport. the ukrainian advisor to the kherson oblast military administration, serhiy khlan, reported on august 4 that russian occupation forces began to detain civilians for trying to exchange rubles to hryvnias in kherson oblast and began making pension payments in rubles to accelerate the forced rubleization of the occupied economy. [37] pensioners hoping to collect their pensions are required to provide their personal information to occupation authorities. khlan also reported that russian forces require ukrainian civilians who wish to have internet or cell phone access to provide their passports and personal information to authorities. ukrainian telegram channel mariupol now reported that residents must bring their passports with them to register to vote in the annexation referenda. [38] the ukrainian mayor of enerhodar, zaporizhia oblast, dmytro orlov, said that russian authorities are using the records of utility companies and the passport information of pensioners to build a database of ukrainian civilian information to falsify the results of the planned pseudo-referenda on accession into rusia. [39] orlov speculated that russian forces are rushing to implement the referenda because ”they are well aware they have almost no time left.” voter registration for russia’s annexation pseudo-referenda in occupied ukraine will likely pose an impossible choice to pro-ukrainian residents, who will need to provide identification to register to vote that can then be used to falsify or disregard their votes. the forced russian passportization of occupied areas and the mass collection of residents’ data will enable occupying forces to better monitor dissent and votes and could allow russian authorities to target and penalize any ukrainian who votes against russia’s annexation, as isw previously reported. [40] russian occupation authorities could also confiscate ukrainian passports, making it more difficult for ukrainian civilians to flee occupied areas. meanwhile, the kremlin is continuing to replace ukrainian collaborators in occupation administrations with russian officials, likely to prepare for formal russian governance of annexed areas. russian authorities replaced the head of the kherson oblast civil-military administration, ukrainian collaborator vladimir saldo, with russian deputy head of kaliningrad oblast sergey yeliseyev on august 4. yeliseyev was an employee of the russian federal security service (fsb) from 1993-2005.[41] saldo announced that he was leaving his position to seek medical treatment after consultations with colleagues and doctors. russian sources reported that he suffered from a form of nervous exhaustion after complications from covid-19, while the russian outlet baza and various ukrainian partisan sources suggested he had been poisoned and was in a medically induced coma.[42] ukrainian partisan channel zalizna palianytsia boasted that the ”fate of the traitors has been decided in advance;” either ukrainian partisans will kill them, or russians will poison them.[43]</td>\n",

Re-registration will require a Russian passport. The GUR also reported that the Russian-appointed Minister of Agrarian Policy for Kherson Oblast, Ukrainian collaborator Oleksii Kovalev, ordered Kherson farmers to register their businesses and pay taxes under Russian law. The GUR also reported that Russian authorities sent letters to businesspeople and self-employed residents of Kamianske, Zaporizhia Oblast requesting that they register their businesses and begin paying Russian taxes.

Russian authorities replaced the head of the Kherson Oblast Civil-Military Administration, Ukrainian collaborator Vladimir Saldo, with Russian Deputy Head of Kaliningrad Oblast Sergey Yeliseyev on August 4. Yeliseyev was an employee of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) from 1993-2005.[41] Saldo announced that he was leaving his position to seek medical treatment after consultations with colleagues and doctors. Russian sources reported that he suffered from a form of nervous exhaustion after complications from COVID-19, while the Russian outlet BAZA and various Ukrainian partisan sources suggested he had been poisoned and was in a medically induced coma.[42] Ukrainian partisan channel Zalizna Palianytsia boasted that the ”fate of the traitors has been decided in advance;” either Ukrainian partisans will kill them, or Russians will poison them.[43]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;
